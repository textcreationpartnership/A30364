            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>IT is too notorious, That the moſt uſual pretenſions of Epiſtles <hi>Dedicatory,</hi> are pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronage from, and their real Scope flatteries of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to whom they are directed. For the former, 'tis an apparent vanity; in that a Worthy Work needs it not, and an Unworthy neither deſerves, nor is capable of it. For the latter, as it ill be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes the entrance of ſo ſerious and ſearching a Subject, as that
<pb facs="tcp:64298:3"/> of this Book, and the impartial ſimplicity of a Miniſter of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Grace and Truth: So I am confident, it would be entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by your Ladiſhip with diſtaſte and contempt. <hi>Madam,</hi> To ſay my errand in ſhort, I do but pay to your Ladiſhip the Legacy of my reverend Brother, and your dear Friend in, and Miniſter from the Lord Jeſus, who is now at ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting reſt; A Legacy worthy his bequeathing, and your Ladiſhips accepting. Yet it is not only a Legacy of Love, but alſo a Debt of Juſtice, both which Obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he was not inſenſible of, when he deſigned and ordered the offering of this excellent Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice more peculiarly to your La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſhip, than to any other. You were not ſo little acquainted with
<pb facs="tcp:64298:3"/> him, as not to know him to be a Perſon immured<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in his Study, and ſtrongly (I wiſh, I could not ſay too ſtrongly) inclined to ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude and privacy. Otherwiſe, his large Talents of Grace, and Miniſterial Abilities, might have rendred him conſpicuous, and met with very large acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments from the truly godly and intelligent, not only to himſelf alive, but to his Pious and Deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late Widow, and his Children after his Deceaſe. <hi>Madam,</hi> I muſt beg your pardon (if it be a fault), that I omit not to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm what I ſaid of the Juſtice of this Dedication; for what can be more juſt, than to render thoſe la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours (next to Gods) primarily to your Service, who did ſo bountifully miniſter to the reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend
<pb facs="tcp:64298:4"/> Authors ſubſiſtence in his greateſt ſtraits, equally to, if not beyond any other mortal; ſo that this work is in no ſmall reſpects your own, and a reaping the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing you have ſowed. But to make it your own beyond the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt a meer Dedication can give you, a ſenſible remembrance of the <hi>Spiritual Bondage,</hi> and a gracious experience of the <hi>Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Freedom</hi> treated of in this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Diſcourſe, will exceedingly conduce.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Madam,</hi> I ſhall not undertake the unneceſſary task of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending the Book, it being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation enough to its ſelf, where it meets with a Spiritual and Judicious taſte. Only I ſhall ſay, That the Author ſpeaks like
<pb facs="tcp:64298:4" rendition="simple:additions"/> one that hath felt and experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced what he ſpeaks, in his own Soul. I ſhall add no farther, only com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend you to God, and to the word of his Grace, which is able to build you up, and to give you an Inheritance among all them that are ſanctified; and ſubſcribe my ſelf,</p>

            <p>ſhall be captivated unto the obedience of his Truth. Theſe Worthies of Chriſt have been very careful to avoid Scandals, and giving Offence, that their Miniſtry might not be juſtly blamed.</p>
            <p>Hence in all things they have approved themſelves as the Miniſters of God, in much Patience and Affliction, in Neceſſities and Diſtreſſes, in Stripes and Impriſonments, in toſſings to and fro, and in labours, in watchings and faſtings, by pureneſs, by knowledg, by long-ſuffering, by kindneſs, by the Holy Ghoſt, by love unfeigned, by the word of truth, by the Power of God, by the armour of Righteouſneſs on the right hand, and on the left; by honour and diſhonour, by evil report, and good report; as deceivers and yet true; as unknown, and yet well-known; as dying yet living [even to a miracle]; as chaſtened and not killed; perſecuted but not forſaken; caſt down but not deſtroyed; being reviled, they bleſs; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing defamed, they intreat; they bleſs and curſe not.</p>
            <p>Touching the Reverend and Bleſſed Author of this Book; it will not be unacceptable to give ſome ſhort Account of him, who was an Interpreter, one of a thouſand, an able and faithful Miniſter of the <hi>New-Teſtament,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:64298:5"/> not of the letter, but of the Spirit; a Miniſter, as of great abilities, ſo of great ſucceſs in his Miniſtry. The Lord himſelf hath erected Monuments to his dead Saints, and took care for the embalming their memories unto poſterity. Whileſt the name of the wicked doth rot, the memory of the juſt ſhall be bleſſed. Whileſt the ungodly are forgotten, or if remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred, 'tis with a note of Infamy; as, <hi>This is that Ahaz!</hi> This <hi>is Jeroboam that made Iſrael to ſin!</hi> the righteous are had in ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting remembrance: Remember them which have the rule over you, who have ſpoken to you the word of God, whoſe faith fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low; conſidering the end of their converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>This holy man of God, Mr. <hi>Nathanael Ball,</hi> was born in the year 1623. at <hi>Pitmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter</hi> near <hi>Taunton Dean,</hi> in the County of <hi>Sommerſet.</hi> His Parents were godly, and of the number of them who in thoſe days were nick-named Puritans. They gave him Religious Education; he received it from their inſtructions and examples. Parents are either the beſt or worſt Copies to their Children; none can do more either to hinder or further their Childrens Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion. They have the greateſt advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages for the ſowing Seeds of Grace in their
<pb facs="tcp:64298:6"/> very many were convinced and converted by him. He ſeldom ſpread the Net of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, but this Fiſherman of Souls caught ſome Soul or other for Christ. He not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly preached publickly, but viſited the Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies of his Congregation, particularly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amining and instructing the ignorant in private, and was never ſatisfied till he had wrought upon them a deep and awakened ſence and feeling of their woful estate by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, the neceſſity of cloſing with the offers of Salvation tendred by Christ Jeſus. He left powerful impreſſions upon their conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences (which stuck as ſo many daggers in their hearts) of the reality of things Invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, That there is a God and Devil, a Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Hell; That they had precious and immortal Souls, which muſt be ſav'd or damn'd; and that as God was merciful, ſo alſo was he a juſt and terrible God, that would by no means acquit the guilty, and that it was impoſſible for them to eſcape the dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of Hell, if they did neglect ſo great Salvation, as was now offered them in this day of their Viſitation. He put all Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of Families in their own Perſons upon the performance of Family-Duties, of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and reading the Scriptures, of Singing and Catechizing, that ſo their Families might be
<pb facs="tcp:64298:6"/> 
               <hi>Bethels,</hi> not <hi>Bethavens;</hi> little Churches of God, not Synagogues of the Devil. And when ſome objected their want of gifts for prayer; he gave them ſuch Directions and Inſtructions both for matter and manner, that in a ſhort time the bleſſed fruits and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects thereof was very viſible; many being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to pour out their Souls in prayer unto God with proper Words, and melting Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions. He always charged them to be upon their knees in prayer; Gods familarity with us, ſhould not make us ſaucy towards him, but to ingage us to keep our diſtance, and to ſerve him with a more holy fear, and filial reverence. The Lord gave him a large ſeal unto his Miniſtry; in ſo much that he was the Spritual Father of many, whom he begat to Chriſt in the Goſpel.</p>
            <p>When he altered his condition, he ſought and found a meet help for him every way; a neighbour Miniſters Daughter, to whom he was Married, and with whom he lived Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligiouſly and comfortably to his dying day, and the bleſſing of God was upon his Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, giving him, by his vertuous Wife, ten Sons and three Daughters. She is now left a deſolate Widow, like the chaſt <hi>Turtle</hi> mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the loſs of her Mate, and her Children Orphans; but he laid up for them Treaſure in
<pb facs="tcp:64298:7"/> Heaven, a ſtock of prayers to the God hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing prayer, and they have the Promiſes. God is the Husband and Judg of his Widow, and Father to the fatherleſs, out of his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Habitation; their Fathers God will be their God, and his ſeed will be bleſſed after him: Leave thy Fatherleſs children unto me, and let thy Widows put their truſt in me, ſaith the Lord.</p>
            <p>In the government of his Family, he was very exact, and ſhewed a rare example of piety to his whole Family. He began with God firſt in his own cloſet, and ſuffered none under his roof to live without ſecret prayer. When it was a convenient time for the whole houſe to meet together, he came from his Study, and ſummoning them to Duty, he expounded one or two Chapters, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined his Children and Servants what they did remember, encouraging the diligent, reproving the negligent; which being done he called upon God for them, and with them. In prayer he was always fervent, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemently wreſtling with the Lord for his bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing. In his daily prayers, he begged hard for Mercy for King and Kingdom, for Church and State; he ſought the proſperity of <hi>Zion</hi> earnestly, and would not brook a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial. Duty being ended, he retired ſhortly
<pb facs="tcp:64298:7"/> upon it into his Study, where he commonly abode till Dinner; and when he crav'd a bleſſing upon his meat, it was in the preſence of his whole Family: he was very ſparing in his diet, and at Table ever turning his diſcourſe Heavenwards, and would lead his guests and family from their mercies to the God of Mercies. At every meal he preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as it were a ſhort Sermon; and Thanks be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing returned unto God, he hastned again into his Study; allowing himſelf no recreation, but what aroſe from reading, praying and instructing others. He ſpent most of his time in studying the Scriptures, ſearching out the Mind and Will God in them; Well knowing, that all humane writings had their defects, but the Book of God was perfect and infallible. He common-plac'd all his reading; this was a store-houſe for preſent and after uſes. At night he carefully kept good hours for Evening-prayer, ſo that his family did not ſerve God between ſleeping and waking. A Chapter being read, and prayer offered up unto the Lord, he withdrew himſelf again into his Study; where, as he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan, ſo he cloſed the day with ſecret Devotion. When he lay down in his bed, it was with ſome heavenly diſcourſes, which took up his time till he fell aſleep. His firſt thoughts in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb facs="tcp:64298:8"/> were of God. His meditations before his upriſing, were improved heavenward. He roſe early, and would diſcourſe in the day, how his reins inſtructed him in the night ſeaſon. 'Tis a thouſand pities, that ſo many precious thoughts as Gods Saints have of God, ſhould be loſt, and not recorded. A godly Gentleman of the <hi>Inner Temple,</hi> told a Reverend Miniſter, that he would not loſe his morning-thoughts of God, for all his worldly eſtate, which yet was a very fair and great one.</p>
            <p>But his obſervation of the Lords day was moſt ſtrict and religious. The fourth Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is the hedg and mound about the whole Law. Break down this, and you violate all the reſt. The <hi>Jews</hi> ſtiled the ſabbath the <hi>Bride of the Synagogue.</hi> This holy man of God decked him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf up for it, as a Bridegroom to meet his Bride. The Sabbath was his delight, and he was exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing careful, not only in his own perſon, but that all in his family and under his charge, ſhould ſanctifie it unto the Lord. He had no worldly buſineſs, no worldly diſcourſes on that day; but he and his whole houſhold ſpent the whole day in the Service of God. Bleſſed is the man that doth this, and the ſon of man that keepeth the Sabbath from polluting it. In his houſe, 'twas the Lords day indeed, the Queen of daies, all his children, ſervants, and whoſo lodged within his
<pb facs="tcp:64298:8"/> gates, were wholly taken up in reading, hearing, repeating, meditating, praying, and ſinging of Pſalms that day. On the Sabbath evenings he examined his childrens &amp; ſervants proficiency by the Sabbath-ordinances, and laboured migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily to awaken their conſciences, and to put them upon early ſeeking of God.</p>
            <p>He was very communicative of his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg. As a Fountain freely yields its water, and the field its corn, and the garden herbs for the uſe of man; ſo did his heart and tongue diſperſe abroad his ſpiritual gifts and experiences to the edification of others. He would talk with any child or ſervant, that ſo he might drop into them ſomething of the myſtery of godlineſs. Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently would he take his younger children in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his cloſet, and offer up particular ſupplicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for them; he would not indulge any of them in a ſinful action. 'Twas his judgment, that a Father might wink at any thing, ſaving ſin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God. Therefore in his uſe of the Rod he deſigned their good. He firſt convinced them of the diſhonour they had done the Lord, the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger they had brought upon themſelves; and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed that as God their heavenly Father had not, ſo neither had he any pleaſure in chaſtiſing them; that ſin being bound up in the heart of a child, 'twas the Lords Ordinance, that the rod of correction ſhould drive it out; and therefore
<pb facs="tcp:64298:9"/> he always accompanied the rod with prayer that ſo they might have the ſpirit and bleſſing of the rod, and correction might be ſeconded with converſion, and crowned with univerſal reformation.</p>
            <p>He ſeemed by his indulgence and kindneſs to his ſervants, a Father rather than a Maſter. He was very compaſſionate on their Souls, and preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed them powerfully to ſecure the main, their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in Chriſt. And ſome of them have cauſe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſtingly to bleſs God, they came under his roof, and ſtood related to ſo pious and good a Maſter.</p>
            <p>The tenderneſs of his conſcience, and great zeal for the purity of Goſpel-worſhip, kept him from conformity. Hereupon with ſome thouſands of his brethren, he was ſlain by that fatal Axe, the Act of <hi>Bartholomew-day.</hi> O! when will the living God give them reſurrection? Lord, revive thy work in the midſt of our days, in the midſt of judgment, remember mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. Theſe <hi>Abels,</hi> tho dead, are yet ſpeaking. The Buſh burns and is not conſumed. Certainly God hath ſome great work for them, who tho ſentenced unto death, are yet alive. We hope in the living God, who quickneth the dead, who hath delivered them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> from many and great deaths; we hope, I ſay, that he will yet deliver them from this death alſo.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:64298:9"/>
            <p> For ſometime after his ſilencing, Mr. <hi>Ball</hi> lived in the ſame Pariſh, where he had been formerly Miniſter; and when the <hi>Oxford</hi> Act came forth, he removed five Miles farther. Where he peaceably behaved himſelf, and won upon many of a different perſwaſion by his moderation, ſweetneſs of deportment, and holy, and unblameable converſation. He bore a ſingular love to all that lookt heavenward, tho of a different perſwaſion from himſelf, &amp; therefore kept up a brotherly and Chriſtian correſpondence with that worthy Conformiſt in whoſe Pariſh he lived. He judged it his du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to preach, and that neceſſity was laid upon him; a wo unto him if he did not preach the Goſpel. Hereupon be neither could nor would be idle, but preached frequently, and ſtudied to preach in ſuch times and places, as were leaſt offenſive to authority. It grieved him to hear his ſpiritual children complain they wanted Bread, when he had it for them.</p>
            <p>Very many reaped the fruit and benefit of his labours ſince he was outed his publick Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry, <hi>as Cambridg, Epping,</hi> &amp; <hi>Bayford,</hi> and other places to which he was related. He ſpent himſelf in doing good to Souls; for mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance he relied upon that providence which feeds the fowls, and cloathes the Lillies; and was of bleſſed Mr. <hi>Hierons</hi> mind, That God
<pb facs="tcp:64298:10"/> who feeds the Ravens, would not ſtarve his young Hierons. And indeed his numerous fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily were maintained to a miracle. He ſought not the world, but his God. He did his maſters work, truſting to his bounty for wages; and would often ſay, he never lived better than when he knew not how to live. He liv'd by faith upon Gods promiſes; committed his ways unto God, and had a firm perſwaſion that the Lord would provide for him and his, which was verified.</p>
            <p>He kept a Diary of Gods providences to himſelf and family, of mercies and afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, of ſupports and deliverances. This quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned him unto thankfulneſs; theſe experiences ſtrengthned his faith, and made him abound in hope, in the Lord his God. When his goods were ſeized on for preaching contrary to Law, this holy man took that ſpoil patiently, and joyfully, knowing that he had a better and more enduring ſubſtance reſerved in the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens and that thoſe loſſes ſuſtained for Chriſt and a good conſcience, would prove gains at laſt, and work out for him a far more exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and eternal weight of glory. If he was concerned, it was for his enemies, whom he pitied from his Soul, and for whom he prayed, as his Lord and Maſter, that they might be forgiven, becauſe they knew not that they did the Devils work.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:64298:10"/>
            <p> His great labours in his Maſters Vineyard, ſhortned his days, but drew him the nearer and ſooner to his reſt. In his ſickneſs his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience was moſt exemplary, bearing his pains with a Chriſtian fortitude, &amp; reſigning him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf for life and death unto his Lords diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal. For him to live, was to glorifie Chriſt, &amp; to die gain. So he might be farther uſeful and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable in his Miniſtry, he was well content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with life; but to be diſſolved and to be at home with Chriſt, being better for him, in caſe of unſerviceableneſs this was earneſtly deſired by him. To ſuch as viſited him in his languiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, he gave ſerious counſels of providing in health for ſickneſs, in life for death, in time for eternity. He was much in prayer for the afflicted Church of God, bitterly lamenting the caſe of <hi>England;</hi> mourning for thoſe great ſins committed in the midſt of us, and trembling at the thoughts of thoſe heavy Judgments hanging over our heads. He ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and ſorrowfully laid to heart the unnatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral breaches among Proteſtants, the diviſions of <hi>Reuben,</hi> the quarrels and enmities among <hi>Joſeph's</hi> Brethren; eſpecially, now the Cana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anite was in the Land. He was grieved at the heart for the unbecoming lives of many Miniſters, and of multitudes of profeſſors of ſo pure a Religion, whoſe lives indeed
<pb facs="tcp:64298:11"/> are a flat contradiction to it, and for whoſe abominations God would certainly viſit (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs there were ſpeedy, ſincere, and extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary humbling and reforming) with ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven worſe plagues than ever. But the Lord took him from the evil to come, after he had languiſhed for ſome time in a Conſumption, and breathed ardently after Heaven and Glory. He was called upon as the Witneſſes, to come up hither. He had long waited for his bleſſed charge, and that ſalvation he had believed, prayed and expected, the Lord his Maſter, whom he had faithfully ſerved, put him into the poſſeſſion of at laſt. He left this life for a better, this vale of tears for a Paradiſe of joys, for rivers of evelaſting pleaſures, the eight day of <hi>September,</hi> and in the year of our Lord 1681. and the <hi>58th</hi> year of his age. <hi>Bleſſed are the dead that dye in the Lord from henceforth; yea, ſaith the Spirit, for they reſt from their labours, and their works follow them.</hi>

                  <hi>The Text opened: The Doctrine inferred thence. The firſt Branch of it handled.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>FOR the making of our paſſage clear to this Text, we muſt look back a little upon the foregoing Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; where we ſhall ſee that Chriſt is a preaching to the people, and what the ſucceſs of his preaching was. In his preaching, amongſt other things, I would deſire you ſpecially to take notice of Two things that he delivers concerning him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; which I mention, becauſe I would by no means have you to let them paſs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are of great moment to your Souls. One is that in <hi>ver.</hi> 12. a very pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious place; Chriſt was <hi>ſent to give light to the World, i. e.</hi> to bring them out of that
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:64298:12"/> darkneſs which they are in by nature. 'Tis juſt as if a man ſtood in ſome diſmal dark place, where he can ſee nothing, knows not where he is, nor whither to go, and one comes to him with a light, and if he does but follow it, it brings him into the open view of things: So Chriſt, thoſe that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him, he leads them into the light of life, into the light of ſpiritual life, that he ſhall ſee ſpiritual things, which no man doth, or can, that does not follow Chriſt; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the light of Eternal life, where, at laſt, he ſhall ſee, and be with God for ever. So that all that live without Chriſt, they live without light; they are dark men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men in their Souls. Another thing that Chriſt preaches to them, is in <hi>ver.</hi> 24. (the Lord open your hearts in the reading of it) <hi>I ſaid therefore unto you, that ye ſhall die in your ſins.</hi> Dying in ones ſins is the ſaddeſt death that a man can die: that perſon <hi>dies to die.</hi> As the children of God <hi>die to live,</hi> ſo theſe, they die to die again. When they die the natural death, they die the Eternal death; they die to be damned, to be ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated for ever from the Lord, as thoſe that he will never have any thing to do with more, but in a way of tormenting them for their living and dying in their ſins. And
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:64298:12"/> theſe of all that die out of the World, are the perſons whoſe death is to be moſt la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented. If God takes away any of your Relations, or Friends, or Neighbours, if you have but good hopes that they died in Chriſt, 'tis comfortable; but this ſame <hi>dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in ſin,</hi> Oh! that's the terrible, that's the lamentable death: as you ſay of ſome perſons ſometimes that died in ſome horrible way, Oh! ſuch an one he came to a ſad end; ſo do all that die in their ſins. A ſad end, the Lord knows. One were better never to have been born, than to die ſuch a death. But I pray mark here, what is it that will bring people to ſuch a death? Why, ſays Chriſt, <hi>If ye believe not that I am he, ye ſhall die in your ſins.</hi> If ye abide Unbelievers, if you don't come to me, own me, give up your ſelves to me, as ſure as can be, ſaith he, this will be your caſe, ye <hi>ſhall</hi> dye in your ſins. There be ſome that die <hi>to</hi> their ſins; that's a good death; and all Gods Children dye ſo. There be ſome that die <hi>in</hi> their ſins; that's a ſad death, as you have heard, and all Reprobate Sinners die ſo. There be ſome that die <hi>for</hi> their ſins eternally, and ſuch are all they that die <hi>in</hi> them; and the way to die in them, and for them, is to live in them.</p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:64298:13"/>
               <p> Theſe, and ſuch kind of things Chriſt is here preaching. I have but named that which I conceive to be moſt needful for you. Well, now what's the ſucceſs of Chriſts preaching to his Hearers? Why, you may obſerve it was this; That of thoſe that heard him, ſome were <hi>complying,</hi> and ſome were <hi>cavilling.</hi> The Lord grant that all of you may be of the firſt ſort, and none of the ſecond. Some were complying Hearers. This kind of Doctrine took upon their Souls, <hi>v.</hi> 30. <hi>As he ſpake theſe words, many believed on him.</hi> Oh that there might be ſuch a preſence and power of God in our Aſſembly here, that as we are ſpeaking, you might be believing, applying, taking home the Truths of the Goſpel, ſo as to be converted to Chriſt. Now theſe kind of Hearers Chriſt encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages, and bids them go on as they had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun, and they ſhould have a Threefold Priviledg. The firſt of them is in <hi>v.</hi> 31. They ſhould be Diſciples <hi>indeed,</hi> not in name, and in ſhew only, but in reality: q. d. I'le own you for <hi>ſincere</hi> ones, ſuch as <hi>Nathanael</hi> was, concerning whom Chriſt ſaid, <hi>John</hi> 1 48. <hi>Behold an Iſraelite indeed, in whom there is no guile.</hi> You have ſome that do offer towards Chriſt, begin as if they would follow his Rules and Doctrine; but they don't <hi>continue</hi> in his Word; and ſo ſhew
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:64298:13"/> that they are not Diſciples <hi>indeed,</hi> none of the right kind of Profeſſors.</p>
               <p>The other Two Priviledges which Chriſt ſaith theſe ſhall have, are in <hi>v.</hi> 32. 1. Ye ſhall know the Truth; <hi>i. e.</hi> have experimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal knowledg of the Truths of God. God and Chriſt would reveal themſelves further and further to them in the matters and my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries of ſalvation: He promiſes inward and ſound illumination to them, that they ſhould have another manner of knowledg of ſpiritual things than they have who have nothing but what ſwims in the brain. 2. That the Truth which they ſhould have an underſtanding of, ſhould make them <hi>free;</hi> not like thoſe that abide in ſlavery and bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage; but they ſhould have a ſtate of <hi>Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now amongſt theſe Hearers, ſome, as I ſaid, were <hi>cavilling</hi> Hearers. And this is the ſad ſucceſs that the Word hath upon ſome, that it ſets them but a cavilling at what is delivered. And thus the Goſpel is the favour of life to ſome, and the ſavour of death to others. Now the carnal and unbelieving Hearers take occaſion unjuſtly to cavil at Chriſt, from thoſe laſt words which he ſpake to his complying Hearers in the Text, <hi>ſhall make you free.</hi> As if they
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:64298:14"/> ſhould ſay, Why then, pray what do you make of us? We perceive, that you count us Slaves, or Bond people. Your Diſciples and Followers ſhall be taken out of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of ſuch as are in thraldom: why then be-like we are no <hi>Freemen.</hi> Here they thought they had a great advantage againſt Chriſt; ſee <hi>v.</hi> 33. <hi>They anſwered him, We be Abrahams ſeed, and were never in bondage to any man: How ſayeſt thou, Ye ſhall be made free?</hi> This that they ſaid was not true in the letter and as to the outward bondage (that they had <hi>never been in bondage to any man):</hi> for had they not been in bondage in <hi>Egypt?</hi> and in bondage in <hi>Babylon?</hi> And they were at this preſent under Tribute and ſubjection to the <hi>Romans.</hi> Note, that a cavilling Spirit is a lying Spirit too: They that are given to the one ſin, are given alſo to the other. But Chriſt did not mean this in the letter, or of any outward bondage; but of bondage by ſin that they were in. And ſo <hi>v.</hi> 34. he doth explain himſelf; <hi>Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever committeth ſin, is the ſervant of ſin, i. e.</hi> is in bondage to it; and ſo will find him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be at laſt, <hi>v.</hi> 35. when he ſhall ſee that he muſt not abide any longer among the Children and Sons of God; but ſhall be ſent away as the Servant, or he that is
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:64298:14"/> bound to his Maſter, is afterwards ſent out of the houſe, while thoſe that are the ſons, and Free ones, are kept in, as thoſe that have a Right, and a Priviledg to ſtay, as I that am Gods natural Son do, and ſhall abide for ever in my Father's houſe, together with all his adopted Children who believe on me.</p>
               <p>This <hi>36th</hi> Verſe, to which I am now come, is Chriſt's drawing a concluſion from all this, applying this that he had been ſpeaking about <hi>Bondage</hi> and <hi>Freedom,</hi> to their caſe, that they, if they had had Grace, might have made a ſaving uſe of it for their own everlaſting good. <hi>If the Son therefore ſhall make you free, ye ſhall be free indeed:</hi> i. e. If I, who am the Son of God, and therefore am free, and can give freedom to others, if I make you free, ye ſhall be free indeed. Wherein you have,</p>
               <p n="1">1. The name by which Jeſus Chriſt calls himſelf, the <hi>Son</hi> of. God; or, as 'tis in the <hi>Greek, that</hi> Son; that is ſuch a Son, as none is: for tho all the Saints are Sons, yet none of them is ſuch a Son as Chriſt is. He hath in all things the pre-eminence. I cannot now ſtand upon this, how far this Son goes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all the other Sons of God, 1. In re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the <hi>manner</hi> of his being the Son
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:64298:15"/> of God, by an unconceivable, eternal Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration. The Saints are the Sons of God by Faith, and by Grace, and by Adoption; but Chriſt by Nature. 'Tis the natural Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledg of Chriſt, to be the Son of God; whereas we by nature were the Children of Wrath. 2. In reſpect of his whole <hi>carriage</hi> towards his Father. He never grieved, or diſpleaſed, or diſobeyed his Father, <hi>v. 29th</hi> of this <hi>8th</hi> of <hi>John, I do always thoſe things that pleaſe him.</hi> But there are many wry treadings that the other Sons have cauſe to mourn for in their beſt walkings. <hi>In many things we offend all.</hi> There's no child of God upon earth ſo good a travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler to Heaven, but that he ſometimes ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles and falls, tho through Grace he riſes again by Repentance. You have that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of a true child of God, whereby he is differenced from the wicked, tho he hath his ſins and failings too, <hi>Jer.</hi> 8. 4. 3. In reſpect of his equality with his Father, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his divine nature. He is ſo the Son of God, as that he is God equal to him, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 6. The Saints are the children of God, and partakers, by Faith, of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Nature; but yet there is an infinite diſtance between God and them: they are Creatures ſtill, tho they be renewed: Tho
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:64298:15"/> they are united to God, yet they are not changed <hi>into</hi> God: But this Son is as holy, as glorious, as great as his Father.</p>
               <p n="2">2. You have here what this Son can do for poor ſinful men: And that is, he can <hi>make them free,</hi> ſet them at perfect liberty, knock off all their chains and bolts where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with they are bound and fettered. <hi>If the Son ſhall make you free: i. e.</hi> I can do it, if you will but be willing.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The nature of this Freedom that he can give to poor ſinners: <hi>i. e.</hi> Freedom <hi>indeed; ye ſhall be free indeed;</hi> or as the <hi>Greek</hi> word is, you ſhall have a Freedom that is <hi>real:</hi> that is, a <hi>ſubſtantial</hi> Freedom; <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>; it ſhall not be an imaginary thing, as that which you now think you have; but it ſhall be a Freedom that hath <hi>Truth and Being</hi> in it, to go as near as I can to the Original Language. Well, now the point is this, That,</p>
               <p>Doct. <hi>The Lord Jeſus Chriſt doth offer a most excellent Freedom to ſinners that are in Bondage; and that 'tis every ones duty to look after his particular ſhare in it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Branches of this Point are Five in number, all of them clearly ariſing from this Text, as you may eaſily ſee.</p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:64298:16"/>
               <p> The 1. Branch, for order ſake, as to my handling of it, is, That ſinners are in Bondage. For to be made <hi>free,</hi> doth ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that ſinners are <hi>not</hi> free. Chriſt ſpeaks to them, as perſons that were not <hi>yet</hi> free. <hi>If the Son therefore ſhall make you free:</hi> i. e. <hi>yet</hi> you are <hi>not</hi> made free, for you com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit ſin; and whoſoever commits ſin, is the <hi>ſervant</hi> of ſin.</p>
               <p>2. Branch, That Jeſus Chriſt doth offer Freedom to poor ſinners that are in the houſe of Bondage. <hi>If the Son ſhall make you free.</hi> You ſee he ſpeaks as one that offers it.</p>
               <p>3. That it is every ones duty to look af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this Freedom, that they be in the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of thoſe that are brought into liberty: And that is in theſe words, <hi>[you free</hi>]. <hi>You</hi> and <hi>you</hi> ſhould labour to obtain it.</p>
               <p>4. That this Freedom comes by <hi>Chriſt.</hi> 'Tis Chriſt that gives it: Whoever is made free, is made free by Chriſt.—<hi>If the Son ſhall make,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>5. That the Freedom which Chriſt offers to ſinners, and gives to believers, is a moſt excellent Freedom. <hi>If the Son therefore ſhall make you free, ye ſhall be free in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed.</hi> As no Bondage is like that Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage, ſo no Freedom is like this Freedom.
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:64298:16"/> Of theſe Five Branches of the Doctrine, I intend, God willing, to ſpeak in <hi>their or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The firſt Branch of the Doctrine is this, <hi>Tbat ſinners are in Bondage.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I ſhall labour to open this Bondage to you in ſome Particulars.</p>
               <p n="1">1. 'Tis a <hi>real</hi> Bondage; 'tis as ſure as any thing in the World, that ſinners are in Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage. 'Tis as true as the Word of God it ſelf is true: For the Word of God tells us ſo. As the liberty that Believers have by Chriſt, is a Freedom <hi>indeed;</hi> ſo the Bondage that ſinners are in, is a Bondage <hi>indeed.</hi> Mark how <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaks to <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> who was one of theſe ſinners, <hi>Acts</hi> 8. 23. <hi>For I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that thou art in the gall of bitterneſs, and the bond of iniquity. q. d.</hi> It may be thou doſt not think, that thou art there; but there <hi>thou art.</hi> Now that this Bondage is a real thing, appears by Two things, to name no more:</p>
               <p n="1">1. By the deſcription that the Scripture gives of the ſtate of ſinners.

               <p n="2">2. By the wonderful awakened ſenſe that thoſe ſinners have of their condition, to whom it pleaſes God to ſhew mercy. Oh how ſenſible they are! and what a World of danger do they apprehend themſelves to be in, and what haſte do they make to get out of it, as a man that ſees he ſtands upon a ſinking ground, that if he does not get off preſently, 'twill ſwallow him up. It ſets them all on a trembling, to ſee where they are, <hi>Acts</hi> 16. 29, 30. Now why have they ſuch <hi>real</hi> deep apprehenſions of their condition? Why, ſurely becauſe they ſee 'tis a <hi>real</hi> Bondage.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This Bondage is a <hi>natural</hi> Bondage; a ſlavery that we have by nature, which is contracted by the Fall of our firſt Parents. We were <hi>born</hi> in bondage: The Fall of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> was the beginning of this Bondage: <hi>there</hi> he, and we in him, loſt our Freedom, <hi>viz.</hi> that holy image of God in which he made us. Pray labour to lay this Fall to heart more: for here was the inlet to all our miſery. Many are apt to think of the Fall of <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve,</hi> as if there were little or nothing that concerned them in it: Whereas, alas! in that very ſin, all our Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom went away, unleſs it were a freedom to ſin; that ſtaid with us ſtill. And, Belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:64298:17"/> let me tell you, you are not throughly humbled for ſin, if you be not humbled for this Original Sin, this Bondage by nature, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51. 5.</p>
               <p n="3">3. 'Tis an <hi>univerſal</hi> Bondage, that includes all that are out of Chriſt, over the whole World. Not one unconverted ſinner is a Freeman. Now Beloved, if any of you ſhould go into a very large Priſon, that hath a great many Rooms in it, and Holes, and Dungeons; and wherever you go, you ſhould ſee all over, the Priſon full, and ſome of them ſeem to be men of good faſhion, and yet notwithſtanding <hi>Priſoners</hi> too; why, when you go out, you would be ready to tell the next body you were acquainted with, If you had been where I have, you would wonder to ſee what abundance of Priſoners there be: The Houſe was even ſtopt with Priſoners; and you would have wondered to ſee what brave proper perſons ſome of them were; and how ſome went in ſuch Cloaths, that one would not have thought that they had been Priſoners, and yet they were Priſoners too. Methinks the World is much like this: The World hath a great many wide Rooms, and Holes, and Corners: There's ſuch a Houſe, and it may be a great many live in that; but then
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:64298:18"/> there's ſuch a Town, or Pariſh, and many more live in that; but then there's ſuch a Shire, or County, and many more live in that; but then there is ſuch a Nation, or Kingdom, and many more live in that; but then there's the whole World, and many more live in that; and generally up and down, the moſt of theſe are Priſoners upon a Spiritual account; and how richly are ſome of theſe cloathed, and how deliciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly do they live in the World! and yet ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of <hi>them</hi> Priſoners too, <hi>walking</hi> Priſoners, <hi>laughing</hi> Priſoners, <hi>learned</hi> Priſoners. In a word, we were all Priſoners by nature; and all that are out of Chriſt are ſo ſtill. 'Tis an <hi>univerſal</hi> Bondage, reaching to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one of them, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 22.—<hi>all under ſin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. This Bondage is a <hi>cruel</hi> Bondage. We read in Scripture of cruel Bondages, as that of the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and in <hi>Babylon,</hi> where they were in the Iron Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace; and yet theſe were but a ſhadow of this. Theſe things that I ſhall now name, you'l ſay your ſelves, will make a very cruel Bondage, and all of them are in a Sinner's Bondage, above any Bondage that is. For I would ſtay a little upon this.</p>
               <p n="1">1. To be ſet to the baſeſt work; to be

The hard Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage of the Children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> is ſet out by this, that they were made to work in Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, and in Brick, <hi>&amp;c. Exod.</hi> 1. 14. baſe dawbing work, that they could never keep themſelves clean. Thus 'tis with ſinners: What doth the Devil imploy them about? Why, they have ſuch filthy work, that they are called <hi>filthy</hi> perſons, <hi>unclean</hi> perſons. In this <hi>John</hi> 8. 44. <hi>Ye are of your father the devil, and the luſts of your father ye will do.</hi> Their work is to do the Devils <hi>luſts;</hi> whatever comes into his filthy mind, that they muſt go upon; or whatever filthineſs he ſuggeſts to their minds, they muſt do it: yea, and they <hi>will</hi> do it, ſays Chriſt. He hath ſuch a power in them, and ſuch a conqueſt over them, that he hath brought their very <hi>Wills</hi> into <hi>obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</hi> They <hi>will</hi> do what the Devil will have them do: therefore 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 26. they are ſaid to be <hi>taken captive at his will.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. To have ſuch a Maſter as hates one The cruel Bondage of the Children of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> is ſet out by this, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 106. 41. Thus 'tis with ſinners, they ſerve the Devil, and they work as hard as they can, (ſee <hi>Jer.</hi> 3. 5. <hi>Micah</hi> 7. 3.) and yet he hates them: While
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:64298:19"/> they do <hi>his work,</hi> he ſeeks <hi>their ruin;</hi> while they are <hi>ſerving</hi> of him, he is <hi>ſlaying</hi> of them: For do what you will, or can for the Devil, you can never make him your friend. He is, and he will be an enemy to all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind. He won't do that which the World does: the World will love its own, but the Devil won't love <hi>his own.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. To have <hi>many</hi> Maſters at once. But you will ſay, Chriſt himſelf ſays, that <hi>no man can ſerve two Maſters.

The Devil he is <hi>tempting,</hi> and the World that is <hi>alluring,</hi> and the Fleſh that's <hi>craving,</hi> and Luſt that's <hi>raging,</hi> and all at one and the ſame time. What a cruel Bondage is this!</p>
               <p n="4">4. To be allowed <hi>no Reſt. Get you unto your burdens,</hi> ſaid <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> in that Bondage in <hi>Egypt;</hi> ſee <hi>Exod.</hi> 5. 4, 5. He could not endure that they ſhould have any reſt. So
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:64298:19"/> the Devil allows no reſt; he is a reſtleſs Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit himſelf; he is deſcribed as one always at work, <hi>Job</hi> 1. 7. He comes <hi>from going to and fro in the earth; and walking up and down in it.</hi> And after this, he goes and does a great deal of miſchief preſently by Gods permiſſion: He ſtirs up the <hi>Sabe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> to plunder <hi>Job</hi> of Five Hundred Yoke of Oxen, and Five hundred She-Aſſes, and to ſlay the Servants that were with them, all but one, <hi>v.</hi> 14, 15. And then he was permitted to burn up Seven thouſand Sheep, and the Servants with them, all but one, <hi>v.</hi> 16. And then he got the <hi>Chaldeans</hi> to come and carry away Three thouſand Camels, and kill the Servants with them, all but one, <hi>v.</hi> 17. And yet he cannot reſt. Then he gets the Houſe to fall upon <hi>Job</hi>'s Children, and killed them, <hi>v.</hi> 19. Now one would have thought when he had done all this miſchief, and eſpecially to one man, he ſhould have been quiet; but he is at work ſtill otherwhere, after all this, <hi>cap.</hi> 2. 2. <hi>Going to and fro in the earth,</hi> &amp;c. and now he comes again, to beg that he may do more miſchief to <hi>Job</hi> yet; and ſo he does, when God had given him leave, <hi>v.</hi> 7. <hi>he ſmote Job with ſore boils, from the ſole of his foot unto his Crown.</hi> Now
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:64298:20"/> I ſay, he is a reſtleſs Spirit himſelf, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways doing miſchief: and ſo he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires that all that ſerve him ſhould be <hi>always</hi> at his work too. 'Tis an expreſſion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning thoſe that are the Devils Slaves, that they cannot <hi>rest, Iſa.</hi> 57. 20. He makes them work in their very Beds, <hi>Micah</hi> 2. 1. What a cruel Bondage is this!</p>
               <p n="5">5. To be paid for all ones drudging in nothing but counterfeit Coyn. Now all that the Devil gives his Servants, is but Braſs money. If it looks well, 'tis but waſht over: not any of it hath Gods I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage or Superſcription upon it. 'Tis not like the wages God gives his Servants: 'tis all droſs within. They have pleaſure, but 'tis <hi>counterfeit pleaſure:</hi> They have peace, but 'tis <hi>counterfeit peace:</hi> They have hope, but 'tis <hi>counterfeit</hi> hope, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 3. The Serpent <hi>beguiled Eve</hi>—He paid her all in counterfeit Coin. The beſt wages that the Devil gives for his work, is but deceit, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12. 9. He is ſaid to deceive the World, and the whole World. There is not one that works for him, that is not deceived by him. What a cruel Bondage is this, <hi>to be working</hi> ſo hard, and to be put off with a cheat!</p>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:64298:20"/>
               <p> But yet further, there are two things more, that make this Bondage to be more cruel than any other Bondage: And they are,</p>
               <p>1. That tho the Devil's Servants do their Taſks, <hi>yet</hi> they ſhall be beaten. You read of that cruel Bondage in <hi>Egypt,</hi> That when they <hi>did not</hi> do their Tasks, they were bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, <hi>Exod.</hi> 5. 14. but here they are beaten <hi>tho they do them.</hi> 'Tis a fruit and effect of the Devils Service, that the more one ſerves him, the more one is beaten, the more laſhes, and the more ſtings of Conſcience one ſhall have. To ſerve the Devil, 'tis the way to be beaten black and blew; ſee <hi>Mat.</hi> 27. 3, 4, 5. <hi>Judas</hi> had done his work the Devil ſet him about; he had done out his Task: and <hi>then</hi> is the time that <hi>Judas</hi> muſt be beaten: <hi>Then</hi> Conſcience fell upon him, ſo that he hangs himſelf.</p>
               <p>2. This alſo makes this Bondage more cruel than any other Bondage, that in this Bondage the <hi>Souls</hi> of ſinners are in Bondage. Other Bondages are up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Body, and the outward Man; but this is upon the Soul <hi>chiefly.</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the Members of the Body are under this Bondage too. The eye, that is an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument of ſin, and the ear that's another,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:64298:21"/> and the tongue, and the hands, and the feet, and all the Members are imployed about e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 19. But above all, the Soul, and the Faculties of that, are in this ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual thraldom. The <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding,</hi> bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage is upon <hi>that,</hi> by reaſon of darkneſs, and ignorance: the <hi>Will,</hi> bondage is upon <hi>that,</hi> by reaſon of that ſtubbornneſs and diſobedience that is in ſinners againſt God: the <hi>Affections,</hi> Bondage is upon them, by reaſon of their diſorder: the <hi>Mind</hi> and <hi>Heart,</hi> Bondage is upon them, by reaſon of their being defiled, and hardened: the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,</hi> bondage is upon <hi>that,</hi> by reaſon of its ſearedneſs. So that the very <hi>Seat and Throne</hi> of the Devil is <hi>within</hi> them, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 4. <hi>In whom the God of this world hath blinded the minds of them that believe not,</hi> &amp;c. The Bondage is <hi>within</hi> them. <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 2. <hi>He worketh in the children of diſobedience.</hi> Now what a cruel Bondage is this, to have the precious Soul in the hand of the Devil, to be a Slave <hi>inwardly</hi> to all unrighteouſneſs! This is the Fourth thing in the Deſcription of this Bondage. 'Tis a cruel Bondage that ſinners are in. And then</p>
               <p>5. As 'tis a cruel Bondage, ſo 'tis a <hi>cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed</hi> Bondage: The wrath and curſe of God belongs to this Condition. When the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:64298:21"/> of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were in their cruel Bondage in <hi>Egypt,</hi> yet notwithſtanding they were beloved of God. The Scripture ſays, That <hi>God had reſpect to them, Exod.</hi> 2. 25. He caſt an <hi>affectionate look</hi> upon them. But he hath annexed his high diſpleaſure, and threatned his vengeance againſt all that ſhall abide in this Bondage. He threatens to caſt them off for ever. This you have implied in that <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 30. <hi>out</hi> with them: A little while hence (if they don't now get their Freedom) God will ſend them to their own place: from their Priſon of Sin, to the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of Hell. And therefore amongſt other parts of their Bondage, they are ſaid to be in Bondage to <hi>the Law;</hi> or to be <hi>under the Law;</hi> which becauſe they have broken, and have no ſurety to ſtand up for them, denounceth all its Plagues, and all its Curſes againſt them, let them live never ſo much in the outward Righteouſneſs of the Law, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 10. <hi>As many as are of the works of the law, are under the curſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>6. Yet tho this is a <hi>cruel</hi> and a <hi>curſed</hi> bondage that ſinners are in, it is <hi>not a bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage without hope.</hi> We don't know what a merciful purpoſe the Lord may have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning ſome of you that are yet ſhut up in this houſe of bondage: whether he may
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:64298:22"/> not deal with you as he did with <hi>Iſrael.</hi> Pray read that precious place, <hi>Exod.</hi> 6. 5, to 9. <hi>I</hi> (ſaith God to <hi>Moſes) have heard the groaning of the children of Iſrael, whom the Egyptians keep in bondage; and I have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred my covenant. Wherefore ſay unto the children of Iſrael, I am the Lord, and I will bring you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians, and I will rid you out of their bondage: and I will redeem you with a ſtretched-out arm, and with great judgments. And I will take you to me for a people. and I will be to you a God: and ye ſhall know that I am the Lord your God, which bringeth you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians. And I will bring you in unto the land con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the which I did ſwear to give it to A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham, to Iſaac, and to Jacob, and I will give it you for an heritage: I am the Lord.</hi> If it may but be thus with you now! why, who can tell? There is a way of delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance out of this bondage, if you will but hearken after it; as I ſhall ſhew upon the ſecond branch of this Doctrine, That <hi>Jeſus Chriſt doth offer Freedom to poor ſinners that are in the houſe of bondage.</hi> But before I come to that, I will make a little <hi>Application</hi> of this, That <hi>ſinners are in bondage.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:64298:22"/>
               <p> 
                  <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 1. And are they ſo? Then 1. This may ſerve to caſt an everlaſting contempt and reproach upon all the ways of ſin, in that it brings into and keeps all that walk in them, in bondage. Oh what a thing is ſin now! What do you think of ſin, Sirs, upon this account? Is not this an Enemy that you ſhould all riſe up againſt, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be quiet till you have got it rooted up out of your hearts? Is this a thing to be loved and pleaded for, and to be let alone as if there were no hurt in it? Oh! now methinks I might hope that there is none of you that would ſpeak one word on ſins ſide. Why, behold what it hath done: It hath brought the whole World into ſlave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. As ſoon as ever we began to have any thing to do with it, it took us Priſoners. It made our firſt Father, and all his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren miſerable creatures. It ſet up the Kingdom of the Devil in every one of us. Yea, beloved, there is not a ſin that any of you commit, but would undo you to all e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity, if infinite mercy do not come be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween you and the miſchief that would fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low upon it. I cannot expreſs the evil that is in ſin to you. 'Tis a thing of a dreadful <hi>nature,</hi> and of dreadful <hi>effects.</hi> As for the <hi>nature</hi> of it, 'tis the <hi>tranſgreſſion of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:64298:23"/> Law of God;</hi> 'tis <hi>oppoſition</hi> to his <hi>Will;</hi> 'tis <hi>emnity</hi> againſt his bleſſed and holy Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty; 'tis that which doth, as it were, rend his ſacred Image all to pieces. As for the <hi>effects</hi> of it, it ſeparates God and man from one another; it robs him of likeneſs to him, and communion with him; it har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens his heart againſt all that is good, and inclines him to all manner of diſobedience; 'tis that which fills the World with ſorrow, and is the cauſe of all miſeries in this life, and that which is to come. Oh that I could tell how to bring you out of love with ſin. Why, Sirs, if God ſhould deal with you ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the deſert of one ſin, you would never live a comfortable day. I cannot part with this <hi>

The luſts to which they give up themſelves, are called deceitful Luſts, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 22. and <hi>Heb.</hi> 3. 13. there is expreſs mention made of the <hi>deceitfulneſs</hi> of <hi>ſin: Exhort one another daily</hi> (ſays the Apoſtle), <hi>leſt any of you be hardened through the</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfulneſs <hi>of ſin.</hi> There are many that are wiſe to ſin, but yet they are not wiſe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to avoid the deceits and ſnares that are in ſin. While they nibble at the Bait, they don't ſee the Hook. When the Devil comes to tempt us to ſin, he comes with his wiles and devices; he plays the Serpent, and the <hi>old</hi> Serpent: he will tell a man, that that which is a ſin, is no ſin; and ſo make him believe he is ſerving God, when he is ſinning againſt him. Our Saviour foretells his Diſciples, that <hi>the time comes, that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo kills them, ſhall think that he doth God good ſervice, Joh.</hi> 16. 2. Accordingly the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> profeſſeth, <hi>Acts</hi> 26. 9. That he verily thought with himſelf, that he ought to do many things contrary to the Name of <hi>Jeſus of Nazareth.</hi> He will tell a man, that he may do ſuch and ſuch a thing, for none ſees him; and the poor deluded ſinner thinks that he is hid, becauſe he ſins in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret, or in the dark; whereas the <hi>eyes of the Lord are upon the ways of man, and he</hi>

                  <hi>pondereth all his goings,</hi> Prov. 5. 21. He will tell a ſinner, that there's time enough to repent, when he may die the next hour. He will tell a ſinner, that God is merciful, of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that <hi>he</hi> may miſs of mercy. He will promiſe pleaſure, when 'twill end in pain; and peace, when 'twill end in trouble; and profit, when 'twill end in the loſs of the Soul. He will tell us, that we are juſtified, when we are not ſanctified; and that we are real Saints, becauſe others count us ſo; that our Gifts are Graces, and that we have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with God in Duties, becauſe we have good Expreſſions in our mouths. Oh, Sirs! take heed to your Souls: watch a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all the deluſions of your ſpiritual E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies. There are Four great Deceivers that you are in great danger by: 1. a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful Devil. 2. Deceitful Sin. 3. A de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful World. 4.

Perhaps you may think now, that this will leſſen your guilt: Why, how can I be good? or how can I ſerve God? or how can I leave my ſins? why, I am a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in bondage; and what freedom hath one that is in a Priſon?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> I anſwer, This were ſomething, if it were againſt your <hi>wills;</hi> but you are wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly in this bondage. You are like that ſervant, <hi>Exod.</hi> 21. 5. <hi>I love my Maſter—I will not go out free.</hi> Do you remember what Chriſt ſays? <hi>John</hi> 5. 40. you <hi>will not come unto me that you might have life.</hi> Now conſider but Three things, and you muſt needs ſay this is a <hi>willing</hi> bondage, and therefore inexcuſable. For, 1. You have <hi>ſold your ſelves</hi> into this condition, as thoſe a <hi>Kings</hi> 17. 17. <hi>ſold themſelves to do evil in the ſight of the Lord, to provoke him to anger.</hi> Pray how came you into this bondage? Is it not your own doing? You were not made thus by God. He may ſay as 'tis in <hi>Jer.</hi> 2.
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:64298:26"/> 21. <hi>I had planted thee a noble vine, wholly a right ſeed: how then art thou turned into the degenerate plant of a ſtrange vine?</hi> Our cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption is from our ſelves, and our deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction is from our ſelves. By nature we <hi>yield</hi> up our Members, as inſtruments of unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs That's the Scripture Expreſſion. 'Tis our own voluntary act. 'Twas not poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible that Mankind could ever have come into ſuch thraldom, had they not given up their conſent, and joyned with Satan againſt God.</p>
               <p>2. 'Tis a willing bondage, if we conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the cheap and low terms upon which all this is done. Sinners did not ſtand out to have any <hi>great rewards</hi> in conſideration of their woful ſlavery; but the Devil gets them to be his Servants at an eaſie rate. I don't mean in reſpect of themſelves; for 'twill be a dear bondage to them, without mercy from the Lord; but in reſpect of what Satan does for them: In lieu of all that they do for him, alas! he feeds them with a few painted pleaſures, that carry more ſtings than ſweetneſs in them for the preſent, and that will be turned all into bitterneſs in the latter end, <hi>Job</hi> 20. 12, 13, 14. 'Tis a brand that is laid upon <hi>prophane Eſau,</hi> that <hi>for one morſel of meat he ſold his birth-right,</hi>

               </p>
               <p>3. 'Tis a willing bondage, becauſe you do <hi>not groan</hi> under it. You are <hi>contented</hi> with your Chains, and you are <hi>contented</hi> with your Priſon. Where be your prayers? and where be your tears? and where be your cries to God, that you may be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered? If it were thus with you, you would ſhew that you were unwillingly where you are: and this would be the way to be delivered, as it was with the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in their bondage in <hi>Egypt, Exod.</hi> 2. 23, 24, 25.

               <p n="1">1. Pity poor ſinners that are in this bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage. Can you look upon them, or think of their condition, without compaſſion? Here be Objects of pity, if there be any in the World! Here's matter of prayer for you, to ſpeak to God on the behalf of theſe
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:64298:27"/> poor wretched creatures. Here's matter for your larger hope to work upon. Oh Friends! if you ſaw one of the ſaddeſt creatures that ever your eyes beheld, for worldly diſtreſs, you would beſtow ſome pity and ſome help there. But oh, the pity and the help, and the bowels that theſe do need, whoſe ſouls are in the bondage of ſin! I beſeech you, don't ſee men and women live without the fear of God; and ſuch multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes of ſinners flocking and poſting to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting perdition, as there be, and yet not be affected with their caſe. What <hi>Paul</hi> ſays in another ſenſe to the <hi>Coloſſians, cap.</hi> 4. 18. <hi>Remember my bonds.</hi> I ſay to you, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member ſinners bonds. Prayer may do that in this caſe, which is like to <hi>Acts</hi> 12. 5, 6, 7.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Be thankful for your own deliverance. Oh what cauſe have you to praiſe God for his great mercy to your ſouls! Time was, that you were in bondage, as they are; were the Servants of ſin as they are, and yet you have been graciouſly viſited, and by a mighty hand, and a ſtretched-out arm God hath brought you out of this houſe of bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage: he hath taken off the yoke of your ſpiritual captivity, that now you can ſay, as in <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 31. <hi>We are not children of the</hi>

                  <hi>bond-woman, but of the free.</hi> Well now, what high admiring thoughts ſhould you have of this Grace that is beſtowed upon you through Jeſus Chriſt! Let me commend that Scripture to you: it fits your caſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 106. 1, 2. then verſe 10. to 17.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Love, and live to your Redeemer: A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide ſtedfaſt with Chriſt in your Liberty, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 1. <hi>Stand fact in the liberty wherewith Christ hath made us free, and be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage.</hi> You know when God had delivered his people out of <hi>Egypt, Pharoah</hi> and all his Hoſt went after them, if it were poſſible, to bring them back again: So the Devil, he follows re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed ſouls to have them again if he could. Oh, how he tempts them to get them back! And if that won't do (as it ſhall not with Gods Elect) yet he does what he can to make them live as if they were <hi>not</hi> delivered, as if they were <hi>not purged</hi> from their old ſins. Oh take heed of this! I tell you, Chriſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects now, that you ſhould do his ſervice, as before you did the ſervice of ſin. And as the ſerving of ſin is an Evidence of being in <hi>that bondage;</hi> So 'tis only the ſerving of Chriſt that will be an Evidence that you are come to <hi>this Freedom.</hi> I conclude with
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:64298:28"/> that 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. laſt words of <hi>ver.</hi> 19. and the <hi>20th</hi> verſe, <hi>Ye are not your own: For ye are bought with a price: Therefore glorifie God in your body, and in your ſpirit, which are Gods,</hi> and ſhew by your walking, that you dont forget this mercy, and that you dont make light of it. <hi>Deut.</hi> 15. 15. <hi>Thou ſhalt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that thou waſt a bondman in the land of Egypt, and the Lord thy God redeemed thee: therefore I command this thing to day,</hi> All God's commands <hi>to you,</hi> are grounded upon his redeeming-kindneſs.

               <p>I Come now to the ſecond Branch of the Doctrine; which is, <hi>Thht Jeſus Chriſt doth offer freedom to poor ſinners that are in the houſe of bondage. If the Son ſhall make you free.</hi> It carries an offer of Freedom in it. I ſhall ſhew,</p>

               </list>
               <p>To the 1. From this kind of Expreſſion, <hi>If the Son ſhall make you free,</hi> obſerve Two Things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That this Offer is <hi>real.</hi> Chriſt doth not deceive, or diſſemble with ſinners, but
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:64298:29"/> really he doth deſire they ſhould have Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty. Men ſometimes make offers of good things to one another, but they are not ſincere in them. But it is not ſo with Chriſt: He is a real well-wiſher to ſinners ſouls. He hath expreſt it all the ways that can be deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. Would you believe his reality, if he does <hi>wooe</hi> ſinners? Why, ſo he does, <hi>Luke</hi> 14. 23. <hi>compel them to come in, viz.</hi> by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunate entreaty. Would you believe his reality, if he does <hi>wait</hi> for ſinners? Why, ſo he does, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 20. <hi>Behold I ſtand at the door, and knock,</hi> &amp;c. Would you believe his reality if he does <hi>weep</hi> for ſinners? Why, ſo he does, He wept over <hi>Jeruſalem, Luke</hi> 19. 41, 42. Would you believe his reality if he does <hi>dye</hi> for ſinners? Why, ſo he did, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 8. <hi>While we were yet ſinners, Chriſt died for us.</hi> Nay, would you believe his reality if he ſhould be <hi>damned</hi> for ſinners? Why, ſo he was, tho not in reſpect of the place, yet in reſpect of the pains of Hell: <hi>He was made a curſe for us, Gal.</hi> 3. 13. What would you have Chriſt to ſay or do more than he hath ſaid and done, to convince you, that he would have ſinners to be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of this Freedom. Hath he not ſaid ſo in his word? Hath he not ſealed it with his blood? Hath he not accepted and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:64298:30"/> from time to time, whoever came unto him? Doth he not engage himſelf by his faithful promiſe, to do ſo ſtill to the end of the World, That he <hi>will in no wiſe caſt out ſuch as come to him, John</hi> 6. 37. And yet what a wonder is it, that the World is ſo unbelieving ſtill? and ſo hard to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded, that Chriſt hath any loving thoughts or purpoſes towards them? Oh this curſed unbelief, and hardneſs of heart, that is in men and women, that makes them, that they will not come to Chriſt that they might have life!</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>If the Son ſhall make you free</hi>]. Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve from it, That this Freedom is <hi>needed</hi> by ſinners. Spiritual Freedom is one of their greateſt wants. This is implied in Chriſts offer. There is a Two fold need that we have of things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. There is a need for <hi>conveniency,</hi> That tho one could make a ſhift to be without ſuch a thing, yet it would be more conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient a great deal, to have it. They could do <hi>better</hi> with it, than without it. Now 'tis true, That ſinners have this need of Chriſt, and the benefits of his Redemption, it would be highly convenient for them. Chriſt is ſo fit and ſuitable to their condition, that the leaſt that can be ſaid of it is, That to be ſure
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:64298:30"/> they can do better with him than with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out him. If they had Chriſt, and had the Freedom that he offers them, it would not at all be inconvenient for them. He would be no hindrance to them: It would be <hi>more</hi> for their profit, and <hi>more</hi> for their good, than it can be now. If they had him, he would be no clog nor burden. Let them look to it how they can do well without him: I am ſure they might do better with him. No ſoul receives him to his loſs. It will be to our loſs to refuſe him, but it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be to our loſs to receive him. Can it be to ones loſs to become a child of God? See <hi>John</hi> 1. 12. <hi>As many as received him, to them gave he power</hi> (right or priviledg) <hi>to become the Sons of God, even to them that believe on his name.</hi> Why, therefore I war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant thee, poor ſinner, if thou hadſt Chriſt, he would not hurt thee; he would be <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient</hi> enough for thee. But alas! this is too low: This is not worthy of Chriſt, to ſpeak meerly in this kind of way. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,</p>
               <p n="2">2. There is a need for <hi>neceſſity,</hi> for <hi>abſolute neceſſity,</hi> That if one hath not ſuch a thing, there is no ſhift can be made, in the world, without it. You may bring this and that, and try whether 'twill ſerve inſtead of it,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:64298:31"/> but all wont do. If you had but <hi>that,</hi> that would do <hi>alone,</hi> but nothing will do with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it. Now <hi>ſuch</hi> need there is of Chriſt, <hi>nothing</hi> will do without him: <hi>There's not ſalvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven, given amongſt men, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we muſt be ſaved, Acts</hi> 4. 12. There be many that have tryed to get their freedom, and pardon, and ſalvation in another way, but all in vain. Some have gone to an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Profeſſion for it; ſome have gone to this and that Opinion for it; and ſome have gone to Duties, and to the Righteouſneſs of the Law for it: but all would not do. No: why, 'tis Chriſt that is the <hi>one thing needful.</hi> Oh beloved! labour to preſs and urge this upon your ſouls; You <hi>muſt</hi> have Chriſt; and therefore aſk thy ſoul, Soul, why doſt ſtand a dallying, and a trifling? and why art ſo hard to be perſwaded to cloſe with him? Why, have him I <hi>muſt,</hi> and therefore have him I <hi>will.</hi> I know there's this and that in my way to hinder me; but through Gods help, nothing ſhall hinder me; I'le break through all difficulties. I, poor ſoul, the Lord grant thou maiſt: and I am confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that if thou once comeſt to this, the Lord will give him thee. He never denies Chriſt to them that will take no denial. If
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:64298:31"/> they <hi>will</hi> have him, they <hi>ſhall</hi> have him. 'Tis a very obſervable and encouraging Scripture, in that diſcourſe of our Saviour with the woman of <hi>Samaria, John</hi> 4. 10. <hi>Jeſus anſwered, and ſaid unto her, If thou kneweſt the gift of God, and who it is that ſaith to thee, Give me to drink, thou would<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt have asked of him.</hi> The <hi>Greek</hi> word ſignifies, thou would'ſt have asked like an importunate beggar, that <hi>muſt</hi> have what he came for: And what follows? <hi>and he would have given thee living wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>If the Son ſhall make you free</hi>]. Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve again in this Offer, That Chriſt <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents ſinners</hi> with his mercy. He is afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand with them. They do not ſay to Chriſt, Pray, will you make us free? but he makes the firſt mention of Freedom to them. Free Grace is the moſt condeſcending thing that ever was. Never did any creature ſo ſtoop to another, as God ſtoops to ſinners. He comes and knocks at <hi>their</hi> door, before ever they knock at his, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 12. <hi>God was in Chriſt, reconciling the world to himſelf.</hi> Mark, the World was not reconciling it ſelf to God, nor God to it ſelf; but God reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the World to himſelf, God's love is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways the <hi>firſt</hi> love: 'Tis the Fountain, and
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:64298:32"/> the Cauſe of our love to him, 1 <hi>John</hi> 4. 19. <hi>We loved him, becauſe he first loved us.</hi> 'Tis true, that the Lord is ſought unto for mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy by them to whom he intends to ſhew it; but 'tis the Lord that ſtirs up their hearts to do it: He ſets them a crying, and then they cry. They come to Chriſt, but 'tis the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that <hi>draws</hi> them. There could be no deſires, or breathings in us after God, if they were not begotten of his Spirit. Alas! our corrupt nature wont afford one good de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, till God give it. It will go further from God, but it wont come nearer to him of it ſelf. And therefore the mercy of God to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards poor ſouls, is a very wonderful thing, not only in that it is ſo <hi>large,</hi> but in that it is ſo <hi>early.</hi> It is up before the ſoul is up, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 65. 1. <hi>I am ſought of them that asked not for me: I am found of them that ſought me not: I ſaid, Behold me, behold me, unto a nation that was not called by my name.</hi> Oh, how much are we beholding to Chriſt, for coming to us firſt!</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>If the Son ſhall make you free</hi>]. <hi>If</hi> he ſhall. Obſerve this next, That 'tis much to be feared, whether ſome that have the Offers of Grace, will ever cloſe with them. Here you ſee they had an Offer of Freedom; but Chriſt puts a doubtful word upon it, as
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:64298:32"/> to their acceptance: <hi>If he ſhall,</hi> &amp;c. As if he ſhould ſay, It may be ſome of you will hear of this, and yet never partake in it, but live and die in the bondage that you are in. In this very Chapter, where Chriſt is offering this Freedom, he tells ſome of them in <hi>ver.</hi> 21. that they would <hi>die in their ſins.</hi> Now beloved, oh what a joyful thing would it be, if you would all accept of this Freedom, and cloſe with this Grace that is offered to you! Why, truly it would be ſuch a joyful thing, if <hi>but one</hi> amongſt you ſhould accept of it, that it would be enough to ſet all Heaven a rejoycing, <hi>Luke</hi> 15. 7. 10. And why ſhould I not hope, but that it may be thus with ſome or other of you? yea, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps with many of you. The Lord grant, that there may not be one amongſt you, that ſhall turn his back upon Chriſt. Whoever that man or woman ſhall be, wo be to them. And yet now 'tis much to be feared, that Chriſt will be rejected by ſome, to whom he hath been offered. The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> tells the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> that he was <hi>with them in weakneſs, and in fear, and in much trembling,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 3. Why, what made <hi>Paul fear and tremble</hi> ſo, that while he was a preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, he was, as 'twere, all of a <hi>trembling?</hi> What, was it becauſe he was afraid to preach?
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:64298:33"/> No: but he was afraid what his preaching would come to, in reſpect of ſome of them, whether <hi>ever</hi> it would profit them, whether <hi>ever</hi> it would prevail with them. Now give me leave to acquaint you a little, what things, as to ſome perſons, may be grounds of fear, whether ever they will cloſe with Chriſt's gracious offer of Freedom.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In that there be ſo few, in compariſon, in all Ages of the World, that have done it. Beloved, Chriſt's flock will be but little, when he hath gathered all his ſheep. Heaven would hold a thouſand times more than ever will come there. No doubt but there be ſome that ſeem now, as if they had cloſed with Chriſt, and yet will be found at laſt not to have done it. They have miſtaken their whole work, and their hearts have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived them from the beginning to the end. A right cloſing with Chriſt, is a very exact thing: 'Tis not every one can hit on it, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. 14. <hi>Strait is the gate, and narrow is the way that leadeth to life, and few there be that find it.</hi> And therefore may it not be feared, that this preſent Generation; yea, and this preſent Aſſembly, may have ſome amongſt them that will never cloſe with Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel Offers?</p>
               <pb n="45" facs="tcp:64298:33"/>
               <p n="2">2. The little good news that there is up and down where the Goſpel comes, of the converſion of ſouls. People flock to Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; but <hi>who believes our report, or to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed?</hi> Sinners a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biding in an unconverted condition, is a great ground of fear, what will become of their ſouls. If you have not yet <hi>cloſed</hi> with Chriſt, as unregenerate perſons have not, we cannot but fear you may loſe him. If a man be in a very dangerous ſickneſs, is there not cauſe to fear he will die? So if a man be ſtill out of Chriſt, why, certainly this is ſomething to queſtion, whether ever he will be in him, <hi>Acts</hi> 8. 22. <hi>Peter</hi> puts it as a doubtful caſe, whether ever <hi>Simon Magus</hi> would be pardoned his ſins, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he was ſtill in an unrepenting condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p n="3">3. When men do ſet light by Chriſt, and the Offers of Grace. There's great hopes of thoſe ſouls, that tho they have not cloſed with Chriſt, yet they begin to have good thoughts of him and his mercy, and love, and ſalvation, is ſomewhat commended; if they acknowledg, yea truly, this is the rich goodneſs of God, that ever ſuch Offers ſhould be made to me. I confeſs I do look upon Chriſt, and the Freedom that he holds
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:64298:34"/> forth to poor ſinners, as an excellent thing. God forbid that I ſhould ſay to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. I know the pardon of ſin, and the love of God, are great Priviledges; happy is that ſoul that hath them: and I would I might be one of them. Ay, why, this is ſomething. Methinks 'tis a kind of Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage that would give one ſome hope con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning ſuch a ſoul, as the young man in the Goſpel, when he did approve and commend of what Chriſt ſaid in <hi>Mark</hi> 12. 32, 33. <hi>Well, maſter, thou haſt ſaid the truth,</hi> &amp;c. is anſwered by Chriſt, <hi>v.</hi> 34.—<hi>Thou art not far from the kingdom of God.</hi> But now when a man ſhall look upon all that Chriſt offers to him, as nothing, and ſet himſelf to deſpiſe and diſgrace his invitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as if Chriſt had done him no kindneſs in ſending all his meſſages of love to him; and let Chriſt go where he will, and his ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation go where it will, for his part, he does not care for them. This is a great ground of fear, that ſuch a perſon will never cloſe with the Offers of Grace. See <hi>Mat.</hi> 22. 3. Thoſe who in the Parable were called to the Marriage-Supper, it's ſaid, firſt they <hi>would not come:</hi> then <hi>ver.</hi> 4. being invited again, <hi>ver.</hi> 5. they fell a ſlighting of it, or, as in the <hi>Greek,</hi> they ſet it all at nought: and <hi>ver.</hi> 6.
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:64298:34"/> they dealt with his Servants, as if he that had ſent them had been their Enemy. Why, ſee <hi>ver.</hi> 7. what becomes of theſe perſons; they were <hi>deſtroyed, and their City burnt;</hi> and compare with it, <hi>Luke</hi> 14. 24. for 'tis all to the ſame purpoſe: they were not to <hi>taſte of the ſupper.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. Another ground of fear, that ſome will never cloſe with Chriſt, is, when they <hi>turn back</hi> again from that forwardneſs to good things which they began to put forth. They ſeemed to have a love, and a zeal, and a deſire towards Chriſt: But it may be they are now grown dead, and cold, and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs. They had fine and hopeful <hi>buds</hi> a while ago. One might ſee how they were convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, and ſtirred. Oh, what hope was there, that ſuch a one would prove a Convert and a Saint! But it may be all is gone, and worn off. Their goodneſs was but <hi>like a morning cloud, and as the early dew it paſſed away, Hoſea</hi> 6. 4. 'Tis thus, beloved with many that make a Profeſſion: They promiſe fair at the firſt, and for a while, but then there comes ſomething, and <hi>turns off ſuch a one,</hi> and then there comes another thing, and <hi>turns off ſuch a one,</hi> and Chriſt and they are parted for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. And therefore I beſeech you, as you
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:64298:35"/> love your ſo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> take heed of growing looſe, and vain, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> lukewarm, after you have begun to have ſet out for God. Oh! con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider what a ſerious thing Religion is: and if you begin to own it, why, ſtand to it, charge your hearts againſt back-ſliding. 'Tis a great ſin to fall off from good beginnings, and exceeding dangerous to the ſoul; ſee 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 20, 21. <hi>If after they have eſcaped the pollutions of the world, through the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of the Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, they are again intangled therein, and overcome; the latter end is worſe with them than the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning. For it had been better for them not to have known the way of righteouſnes, than after they have known it, to turn from the holy commandment delivered unto them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. Another ground of fear of this, is when perſons are grown old, and are ready to go out of the World, and yet have not cloſed with Chriſt; that they have let it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone all their life hitherto, and now their <hi>life</hi> is even ſpent by courſe of nature. I would diſcourage none, tho they be ſtricken in years, from looking out for Chriſt. I know God is not bound to any time: He ſaves <hi>whom he</hi> will, and calls <hi>when he</hi> will But oh, you that have put off cloſing with Chriſt till
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:64298:35"/> old age, why, why did you not minde it ſooner? I ask you, Is this the <hi>fitteſt</hi> time for ſuch a work? or the <hi>likelieſt</hi> time for ſuch a work? Do you think there is not ſome reaſon to fear, leſt you ſhould die Chriſtleſs, as you have lived thus far with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out him? I dare not ſay that your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition is hopeleſs; but I will ſay, that the condition of young ones is more hopeful: Chriſt hath ſaid, <hi>They that ſeek me early, ſhall find me,</hi> Prov. 8. 17. I am certain, 'tis the great deſign of the devil to do what he can to hinder perſons from being good while they are young, becauſe he hopes that then they won't be good when they are old.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>If the Son ſhall make you free.</hi>] <hi>Shall make</hi> you; obſerve one thing more from this kind of Expreſſion, <hi>viz.</hi> That upon whomſoever Chriſt beſtows this Freedom, he takes in the <hi>conſent and will</hi> of that perſon in the doing of it. Tho at the firſt, there is an unwillingneſs in the Soul, and Chriſt hath a croſs piece to deal with, and there's ſomewhat to do to get its conſent (as there is ſometimes in a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, to whom a man goes with a deſire to take her for his wife, ſhe is hard to be won) yet at laſt, the free and the full conſent
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:64298:36"/> comes: So that when Chriſt hath put the queſtion, <hi>Soul, ſhall I make thee free?</hi> and hath preſſed it home with plentiful and powerful Arguments (as he knows how to do it) the Soul is brought to make this anſwer, <hi>Thou ſhalt make me free;</hi> much like to that, <hi>Gen.</hi> 24. 57, 58. where <hi>Rebekah</hi> being askt, Whether ſhe would go with <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſervant, anſwers, <hi>I will go.</hi> The match between Chriſt and the Soul, 'tis not a forced buſineſs altogether; not but that he puts forth an holy violence in the work, elſe he would never obtain his ſuit: he <hi>compells</hi> them to come in; but it is ſuch a compulſion that carries ſuch love with it, as that the Soul neither <hi>can</hi> nor <hi>will</hi> finally ſtand out againſt him, but it caſts it ſelf at laſt into his arms and boſom, and 'tis <hi>glad 'tis there,</hi> Cant. 2. 3. And unleſs Chriſt ſhould take in the will of the Soul, the Soul and Chriſt could never live comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably together; and that's the great deſign of Chriſt, that the Soul ſhould live comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably with him, that it ſhould have a huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band that ſhe can rejoice in. Yea, the ſoul is made ſo willing, that it would have Chriſt upon any terms. If Chriſt ſhould, to try the truth and the conſtancy of her love, make as if he would not have her, and ſeem
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:64298:36"/> to caſt her off, oh the thoughts of this would wound her, and grieve her ſo, as that ſhe cannot but faint under it: nothing will ſatisfie her but his perſon and preſence, <hi>Cant.</hi> 1. 2, 3, 4. <hi>Let him kiſs me with the kiſſes of his mouth, for thy love is better than wine.—Draw me, we will run after thee.—We will be glad and rejoice in thee, we will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member thy love more than wine.</hi> You ſee how ſweetly the Soul comes off to him; ſhe <hi>reſolves</hi> to run after him, and <hi>reſolves</hi> to love him, and <hi>reſolves</hi> to rejoice in him.</p>
               <p>Hence then you may know, when there is like to be a match betwixt Chriſt and your Souls. How do your wills come off to the buſineſs? Are your <hi>affections</hi> turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing towards him, and prizing of him? That's a ſign that Chriſt hath laid ſome good hold upon you, if he holds you <hi>by the heart.</hi> God hath undertaken, that Chriſt ſhall have the <hi>free conſent</hi> of thoſe whom he is to make his own, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 110. 3. <hi>Thy people ſhall be willing in the day of thy power. Iſa.</hi> 55. 5.—<hi>Nations that knew thee not, ſhall</hi> run <hi>unto thee.</hi> It is therefore this <hi>willingneſs</hi> that we pray that God would work in you; <hi>and when that is once wrought, let all the devils in hell keep you from Chriſt if they can.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="52" facs="tcp:64298:37"/>
               <p> The ſecond thing propoſed to be inquired into, upon this ſecond Branch of the Point, is, <hi>Where Chriſt offers this freedom.</hi> And I anſwer, Where ever the Goſpel comes. You that live under the Goſpel, and the preaching of the Goſpel, you live under a Diſpenſation, where <hi>Soul-freedom</hi> is to be gotten. You ſhall find, that when the preaching of the Goſpel is ſpoken of, it is ſet forth as a Diſpenſation, under which poor ſinners that are in bondage may come to Freedom. Thus <hi>Act.</hi> 26. 17, 18. Chriſt ſayes, that he <hi>ſent Saul to the Gentiles, to turn them from the power of Satan unto God.</hi> So, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 4. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaking of his Preaching, he ſaith, 'twas for the caſting down of <hi>ſtrong holds;</hi> that is, whatever holds a ſinner in his ſpiritual Bondage, why this ſame Goſpel which was preached by him, is a Diſpenſation for the pulling of it down, that by it, through the power of God going along with it, the impriſoned, inſlaved ſoul, may be come at, and ſet free. So 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 25, 26. when <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks to <hi>Timothy</hi> about his preaching the Goſpel, he bids him inſtruct in meekneſs <hi>them that op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe themſelves,</hi> &amp;c.—and that they may <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover themſelves out of the ſnare of the devil, who are taken captive by him at his will,</hi> &amp;c.
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:64298:37"/> ſhewing, that the Goſpel is a Diſpenſation where Freedom may be gotten. And hence you may ſee, that this great Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of preaching Chriſt to you, is ſet up and appointed by God for the bringing to paſs of great things. 'Tis the Lords migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Engine, to work ſinners out of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of the devil; which when once 'tis done, oh how will a poor ſoul admire Gods goodneſs to it, and be thankful! So was it with the Apoſtle <hi>Paul, Col.</hi> 1. 12, 13. <hi>Giving thanks<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> unto the Father, which hath made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of ſaints in light: Who hath delivered us from the power of darkneſs, and hath tranſlat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us into the kingdom of his dear Son.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And you, Sirs, that are yet out of Chriſt, that come hither and hear the Goſpel preached, you muſt know that this is one of the Places and Aſſemblies in which Chriſt offers Freedom to you: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, the great end of your coming hither ſhould be, that you may <hi>get your freedom.</hi> Don't come for <hi>Faſhions</hi> ſake, but for <hi>Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms</hi> ſake; that you may not any longer remain in this cruel, curſed Bondage, which I have ſhewed you are in.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> But you ſaid, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> offers this Freedom: I don't ſee that Chriſt is here.</p>
               <pb n="54" facs="tcp:64298:38"/>
               <p> 
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 'Tis true, he is not here perſonally: Time was that Chriſt in his own perſon was in the World, and offered this Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; he ſpake theſe words here in the Text with his own mouth, <hi>If the Son ſhall make you free, you ſhall be free indeed.</hi> If you had lived in thoſe days in which Chriſt was upon Earth, and in any of the places to which he came, you might have heard Chriſt himſelf preach, and inviting and incouraging poor ſinners to come unto him, and take this Freedom: for when he was here, he made it his buſineſs to offer it up and down where ever he came. But that was but for a while; that bodily pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of Chriſt was quickly withdrawn; after that he died and roſe again, and aſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into Heaven, and there he ſits at the right hand of God, till he ſhall be revealed from Heaven with his mighty Angels in flaming fire, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1. 7, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But in another ſenſe he is here ſtill; and 'tis as well for the getting of your Freedom, as if he were here in perſon.</p>
               <p n="1">1. He is here by his <hi>Embaſſadors;</hi> what we do in his Name, that he doth by us. You never have any Miniſters of Chriſt preaching to you, but Chriſt is by them offering Freedom to you; and in this
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:64298:38"/> Work and Miniſtration that we are about, you ſhould be carried beyond thoſe weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes and infirmities which you ſee in us, and you ſhould conſider whom we repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, as the Apoſtle tells the <hi>Galatians,</hi> that they did ſo at his firſt preaching the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel to them: See <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 13, 14. <hi>Ye know how through infirmity of the fleſh, I preached the goſpel unto you at the firſt. And my tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation which was in my fleſh ye deſpiſed not, nor rejected, but received me as an angel of God, even as Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> And I'll tell you a little, Beloved, for the ſtirring of you up to prize a Goſpel-Miniſtry, what uſe Chriſt is pleaſed to make of us, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to this Freedom (though we are but earthen Veſſels, and poor Creatures like your ſelves) As,</p>
               <p n="1">1. To be. <hi>Publiſhers</hi> of it among you. He commands us and ſends us to blow this Trumpet of the Goſpel in your hearing, to proclaim this joyful ſound to you, <hi>that Chriſt came into the world to ſave ſinners.</hi> We are bound, as we will anſwer to Chriſt, to acquaint you with this good news, that <hi>God is in Chriſt reconciling the world to him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>ſelf:</hi> that now is the time wherein priſon-doors may be opened, and the yoke of your ſpiritual Bondage may be broken all to
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:64298:39"/> pieces: and oh, how ſhould you welcome us in the Name of the Lord, for bringing you ſuch a Meſſage as this is! Such an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment doth the Prophet foretel the Preachers of the Goſpel ſhould receive; ſee <hi>Iſa.</hi> 52. 7. <hi>How beautiful upon the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains are the feet of him that bringeth good tidings, that publiſheth peace,</hi> &amp;c. Beloved, I am ſure that the news of this Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, cannot but be welcome to thoſe that are ſenſible of their Bondage: See <hi>Exod.</hi> 3. 16, 17. <hi>q. d. Moſes,</hi> go and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh this among them, that I will deliver them out of this ſad ſlavery that they are in. Now compare <hi>chap.</hi> 4. 29, 30, 31. where the Meſſage was delivered to them: you ſee how they imbraced it, <hi>they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, bowed their heads, and worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. To be <hi>Pleaders</hi> with you about it. The Lord gives us leave to be exceeding earneſt with you about the matters of your ſouls, to ſtir you up by all the Wayes and by all the Arguments that poſſibly we can, to look after this Freedom. He requires, that we ſhould lay out the very ſtrength of our ſpirits in this Work; that we ſhould deal with you as for our lives, and as for the ſaving of our own ſouls. He would
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:64298:39"/> have us ſtudy what to ſay to you, and to pray much to God, that he would fill our mouths with Arguments when we come to ſpeak to you; and that he would help us, that we may not be willing to let you alone in your trifling careleſs delayes; but to urge upon you the neceſſity of this Freedom, and the danger of miſſing of it, and the benefit that you will reap by it. Miniſters ſhould not only be Publiſhers, but they ſhould be Pleaders, yea, Beſeech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of their hearers in this matter: <hi>We pray you in Chriſts ſtead</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>be ye reconciled to God,</hi> 2 Cor. 5. 20.</p>
               <p n="3">3. To be <hi>Inſtruments for the conveying</hi> of it to you. Through grace, Beloved, we can help you to Chriſt, and help you to Freedom: Thus the man of <hi>Macedonia</hi> that appeared to <hi>Paul</hi> in a Viſion, prayed him, ſaying, <hi>Come over and help us,</hi> Act. 16. 9. Poor ſinners need help for their ſouls, and God hath made his Miniſters helpers; they can help them to Knowledge, and Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and Faith, and out of their Sins, and help them to Heaven. He hath given them Gifts and graces for it, and a Scripture call to the Work; and he hath put a willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in their hearts to do good to ſouls: and he hath, and doth give ſucceſs and
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:64298:40"/> bleſſing to the word of his grace by them, and <hi>by the fooliſhneſs of preaching to ſave them that believe,</hi> 1 Cor. 1. 21. So that Chriſt is here ſtill by his Embaſſadors. But,</p>
               <p n="2">2. Which is more than this, He is here by his <hi>Spirit;</hi> and as long as that is here, there is no fear but Freedom may be gotten. This is the great Succeſſor to Jeſus Chriſt, in that work of doing good to ſouls, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16. 7, 8, 9, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I beſeech you conſider, that the <hi>Spirit</hi> doth attend the preaching of the Goſpel, and therefore 'tis called the Miniſtration of the <hi>Spirit;</hi> and what that can do in our preaching, you may ſee, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 6.—<hi>the Spirit giveth life.</hi> And were it not for the preſence of this Spirit of Chriſt in his Ordinances, both our preaching and your hearing would be in vain. But now, becauſe Chriſt hath ſent his Embaſſadors, and ſends his Spirit alſo with them, I tell you, Beloved, you are under a glorious Miniſtration, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 7, 8, 9, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> becauſe whatever <hi>veil</hi> is upon peoples hearts, and whatever bondage they are in, this Spirit can <hi>take it away, and bring them into liberty,</hi> verſ. 16, 17. But I muſt haſten.</p>
               <pb n="59" facs="tcp:64298:40"/>
               <p> The <hi>3d</hi> Inquiry is, <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon what account Chriſt doth offer this freedom, in reſpect of himſelf?</hi> I will give you an anſwer to this in three things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Upon the account of his <hi>Purchaſe:</hi> he hath purchaſed Freedom, and therefore he may offer it; 'tis his own to diſpoſe of, as a thing that a man hath bought is his own: the Lord Jeſus was willing to buy Freedom for you, that he might give it to you. And here, it may be, you may deſire to be reſolved in two Queſtions. <hi>Qu.</hi> 1. Of whom did Chriſt buy it? <hi>Qu.</hi> 2. And what did Chriſt pay for it? <hi>Anſ.</hi> to the 1. He bought this Freedom at the hand of his Fathers Juſtice: for by ſin we were all fallen into the hand of Juſtice, and out of that hand we could not be taken, but by Chriſts making full Satisfaction to it; therefore he had to deal with a juſt and an angry God in this buſineſs. This is the meaning of that, in <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 4, 5.—<hi>God ſent forth his ſon made of a woman, made un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the law, To redeem them that were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the law, that we might receive the ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption of ſons.</hi> Mark here how 'twas with us, and how it muſt be with Chriſt, that he might redeem us. We were under the Law, <hi>i. e.</hi> we lay liable to all that the Law
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:64298:41"/> could threaten to us, or inflict upon us: And therefore, Chriſt he muſt be, and he was made under the Law; <hi>i. e.</hi> in what he was to do for our Deliverance, he muſt give the Law or the Juſtice of God its full demand: and he muſt not expect to have any thing abated of it, by any ſuch thing as mercy; for he had not at all to deal with that in this work, he was not made <hi>under Mercy,</hi> but <hi>under the Law.</hi> Now from hence we may quickly give an anſwer to the <hi>2d Queſtion,</hi> What did Chriſt pay for this Freedom? <hi>Anſ.</hi> Why to be ſure ſome great price, ſince he had to do with the offended and inraged Juſtice of God. For you muſt know and believe, that for our ſins, the wrath of God was dreadfully kindled againſt us: and if Chriſt would put himſelf in our place, and be our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer, all this wrath muſt dreadfully burn againſt him; he muſt ſuffer ſo, as that he muſt be made a <hi>curſe</hi> for us; and he muſt be ſo bruiſed and broken, and marred by the heavy weight of Puniſhment that lay upon him, that people might even be aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed to ſee him, and ſo as to make him that he could not even be known who he was, he looked ſo ghaſtly. See <hi>Iſa.</hi> 52. 14. and therefore, his precious Life and Blood
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:64298:41"/> muſt go for it; <hi>Body, Soul</hi> and all muſt be filled with the tokens of God's diſpleaſure. And therefore, you ſhall find the Lord, as it were, <hi>ſtirring up</hi> of his Juſtice, as if that it ſelf were too ſlow, againſt him, when his ſufferings are ſpoken of, <hi>Zech.</hi> 13. 7. <hi>Awake, O ſword, againſt my ſhepherd, and againſt the man that is my fellow.</hi> Oh Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved, the great worth that there is in one drop of Chriſts Blood! but in this Work, he muſt <hi>pour it out like water:</hi> See <hi>Pſal.</hi> 22. 14, 15. And therefore, I pray obſerve this, that generally when you have this Redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption of Chriſt ſpoken of his <hi>Blood</hi> is men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned with it, to ſhew what an ineſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble price he paid for it. See <hi>Zech.</hi> 9. 11. <hi>As for thee alſo, by the blood of thy covenant,—Eph.</hi> 1. 7. <hi>In whom we have redemption through his blood.</hi> Heb. 9. 11, 12.—<hi>By his own bloud</hi>—1 Pet. 1. 18, 19. <hi>Ye were not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed with corruptible things,—but with the precious blood of Chriſt—</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Upon the account of his <hi>Pity.</hi> The Pity and tender Compaſſion that was in the heart of Chriſt towards poor ſinners, as he ſaw them lie in their loſt condition; he ſaw they needed Deliverance, and he could not paſs him by, as this and that man did the man that lay among thieves; but
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:64298:42"/> as the good <hi>Samaritan;</hi> he would go to them to pour in Wine and Oil into their Wounds, and bind them up. Do you think, Beloved, that ever Chriſt would have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured, that ſuch cruelty from his Enemies, and ſuch ſeverity from his Fathers Juſtice, ſhould have been exerciſed upon him, if he had not had his heart full of pity towards poor ſinners, as it could hold? Certainly, 'twas his mercy that made him under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go all that miſery. See <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. 1, 2. <hi>Tit.</hi> 3. 4. Beloved, Jeſus Chriſt ſaw that we were <hi>pitiful</hi> creatures by ſin, and by reaſon of what was due to us for ſin, and he did pity us, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 63. 9.—<hi>In his pity he redeemed them:</hi> Yea, and he doth pity us ſtill, and he hath compaſſion for poor ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful creatures ſtill, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. 15. <hi>We have not an high Prieſt that cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities.</hi> Therefore his pity to you makes him, that he cannot but offer this Liberty to you.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Upon the account of his <hi>Power.</hi> He offers this Freedom to ſinners, becauſe he can ſet them free; how faſt ſoever they are bound, he can looſe them. Hence 'tis ſaid, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89. 19. <hi>I have laid help upon one that is mighty.</hi> As the Lord, when he came to redeem <hi>Iſrael</hi> out of their Bondage in
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:64298:42"/> 
                  <hi>Egypt,</hi> he came with a mighty hand, and with a ſtretched out arm: So doth Chriſt, when he comes to redeem a ſoul; let him meet with what as w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

'Tis true, there is a great deal of ſtrength put out againſt him; the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner calls all his ſhifts together, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil calls all his devices together, to reſiſt, but Chriſt is reſolved to have the day.

I therefore urge that Scripture upon you now, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 25. <hi>See that ye refuſe not him that ſpeaketh: For if they eſcaped not who refuſed him that ſpake on earth, much more ſhall not we eſcape, if we turn away from him that ſpeaketh from heaven.</hi> What, ſhall Chriſt make ſuch an offer to you, and will you not cloſe with it? Will you that are in Bondage periſh in your Bondage, when you might be ſet free? Is it ſuch a good condition that you are in, that you ſhould deſire to ſtay in it? The priſon and bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage of the Body, tho it be nothing to this that your ſouls are in, yet how glad are poor Creatures to hear, that there is any hope or way for deliverance out of that. Oh, ſirs, let not Chriſt loſe his love, let him not loſe his labour, let him not loſe his longing: fain he would have you ſet at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty: And therefore, don't hug your chains, as if you were loth to part with
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:64298:43"/> them. Lay this to your heart, that Freedom is offered you; how can you ſhift it, but you muſt cloſe with it now? If it had not been offered, there had been ſome excuſe: but will you put it off, now it hath been offered; yea, when it hath been offered <hi>particularly</hi> to every one of you, that there is none of you have been excluded from this gracious Invitation: and when it hath been offered with a <hi>notwithſtanding,</hi> not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all the great and grievous ſins which you have lived in, as it was ſaid to <hi>Judah, Jer</hi> 3. 1, 2. <hi>Thou haſt played with many lovers: yet return to me, ſaith the Lord:</hi> And when it hath been offered <hi>fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently,</hi> not once or twice, but often; <hi>How often would I have gathered you,</hi> ſaith Chriſt to <hi>Jeruſalem?</hi> God hath ſeen you neglect this Salvation, ſuch a Sermon, and ſuch a Sermon; and yet he hath ſent again, and again, and again to you: And when it hath been offered with ſo much <hi>importuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> and <hi>earneſtneſs,</hi> that you have never been pleaded with about any thing in this World, as you have about getting this Freedom: And when it hath been offered to you ſo <hi>freely,</hi> that you ſhall be redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at anothers coſt, and not at your own: you have ſold your ſelves for nought, and
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:64298:44"/> ye ſhall be redeemed without price: I ſay, when it hath been offered, and thus offered, why what's your duty from all this, but to cloſe with it? 1. Cloſe with it <hi>thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully.</hi> What? Is there yet Freedom for <hi>me,</hi> for ſuch a one as I? Oh, bleſſed be God! admired be his Mercy! adored be his Name! 2. Cloſe with it <hi>throughly.</hi> Take heed of doing it by halves: take heed of parting with your ſins but as <hi>Pharaoh</hi> would part with the children of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> he would yield to this and that upon force, but he never came up to Gods terms. 3. Cloſe with it <hi>quickly,</hi> before your day of Grace be at an end, before it be too late to look out for it. Oh, ſirs! ſtir, ſtir for your ſouls, for the Lords ſake, quickly, quickly; you may elſe be undone to all eternity. Opportunities of grace are not long liv'd; and when they are over, you will wiſh you had improved them, and then there will be no fetching them back. I commend that awakening Scripture to you, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 15, 16, 17. <hi>Look diligently, leſt any man fail of the grace of God, leſt any root of bitterneſs ſpringing up, trouble you, and thereby many be defiled: Leſt there be any fornicator, or profane perſon, as Eſau, who for one morſel of meat, fold his birth-right.</hi>
                  <pb n="67" facs="tcp:64298:44"/> 
                  <hi>For ye know, how that afterward, when he would have inherited the bleſſing, he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected: for he found no place of repentance, though he ſought it carefully with tears.</hi> That may be loſt in a little time, that can never be recovered.</p>
               <p>But becauſe this cloſing with Chriſt is a great Subject, and of ſo great importance; and becauſe I know there is a great deal of backwardneſs in the heart of man to cloſe with Chriſt; and for fear leſt you ſhould not have as mueh ſaid to you as can well be ſpoken by man, to perſwade you to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of this ſoul-delivering Jeſus whom I preach unto you this day: give me leave to carry on the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> ſomewhat further, by way of motive. And tho many things might be inſiſted on to ſtir you up, yet I will ſingle out this one thing eſpecially: namely, to beſeech you to conſider how guilty you will be if you don't cloſe with Chriſt; and what grievous ſinners you are, and will be found to be at the great day of his appearing.</p>
               <p n="1">1. You are guilty of <hi>Ignorance.</hi> You'll ſhew your ignorance of Chriſt, that his worth and excellency was never ſeen by you, that you never took him to be a Pearl of great Price; for if you had, to be ſure
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:64298:45"/> the next thing would have been to make him yours, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13. 45, 46. Beloved, there is none that ever refuſed Chriſt, that knew him; I don't mean, that knew him after the fleſh, or that ſaw him with the eye of the body; there were many that beheld him ſo, and had no deſire to him, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 10, 11. but none that ever knew him in a ſpiritual manner, but fell in love with him: He draws all the hearts, and all the affections of them to whom he hath been revealed by the Holy Ghoſt. It is therefore certain, that you dwell in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to this day, if you have no mind to cloſe with Chriſt; for if you were brought into the light, you would follow him.</p>
               <p n="2">2. You are guily of <hi>unthankfulneſs.</hi> What! to make ſuch a ſad requital to Chriſt for all his kindneſs towards you, as to prepare ſuch good things for you, and now to have none of them! Why, hath he not deſerved better at your hands then this? Was there no love, nor no mercy to your ſouls in what Chriſt hath done for poor ſinners? Nay, did you ever hear of the like love, or the like mercy? Is it not beyond all compariſon, and beyond all expreſſion? Did you ever hear of a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour that delivered from ſo great danger?
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:64298:45"/> Did you ever hear of a Surety that under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took to pay ſuch great Debts? Did you ever hear of a Phyſician that healed ſuch great Diſeaſes? What, and ſhall this be all the thanks he ſhall have now, to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected? If God will take it ill at your hands, to paſs by thoſe mercies that are but for the comfort of your bodies, without thankfulneſs; how much more will he be diſpleaſed with you, for paſſing by the offers of thoſe mercies that are for the ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of your Souls? Why, Sirs, you that refuſe Chriſt, where is your ſenſe of God's goodneſs? where is that acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement that he ſhould have from you? Hath he done you no courteſie in ſending his Son? Is the very hopes and poſſibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of being recovered out of your loſt condition, a thing not to be <hi>at all</hi> affected with? If a man doth but offer you his help in your need, you'll thank him, and you'll ſhew that you are taken with his kindneſs, by accepting of it; and you'll tell him how much you are beholding to him, and that you ſhall own him for your Friend as long as you live. Why, where is your thankfulneſs to Chriſt then? why don't you own him for your Friend? <hi>Obj.</hi> Why, you'll ſay perhaps, We are
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:64298:46"/> thankful to Chriſt for his kindneſs to poor ſinners? <hi>Anſ.</hi> What, and not cloſe with him? how can that be? 'tis the cloſing with him that is the thankfulneſs to him. If you do not this, you may ſay you are thankful, but who will believe it? ſhew it by your acceptance, <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 1, 2. <hi>Giving thanks unto the Father, who hath made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the ſaints in light.</hi> They give thanks; but ſee <hi>verſ.</hi> 14. they had cloſed with it; <hi>We have redemption through his blood, even the forgiveneſs of ſins.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. You are guilty of <hi>Willfulneſs.</hi> It may be you'll put it upon your weakneſs that you don't cloſe with Chriſt: and I grant indeed that you are without ſtrength, and that you muſt have a power beyond your own to inable you, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6. 44. <hi>No man can come to me, except the Father which hath ſent me, draw him:</hi> and if ever you come to him, it muſt be by grace from above. But yet, I pray conſider, that it is ſuch a weakneſs, as is joined with <hi>wilful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Joh.</hi> 5. 40. <hi>Ye will not come unto me, that ye might have life.</hi> The great thing that hinders your cloſing with Chriſt is, <hi>your will is againſt it.</hi> I am certain, that if you were but willing, you would do it: only
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:64298:46"/> you muſt know what a willingneſs I mean; Such a willingneſs as is ſpoken of in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 110. 3. <hi>Thy people ſhall be willing in the day of thy power.</hi> Oh, if the power of Chriſt were but once come upon your wills, to turn them, and bring them in, you would run to him with ſtrong and ſwift deſires. If ſinners were not willful in refuſing of Chriſt, do you think that God would ever charge them with willfulneſs? <hi>How oft would I have gathered you?</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and ye</hi> would not, ſaith our Saviour of the Jews, <hi>Matth.</hi> 23. 37. A wicked man carries it ſo to Chriſt, as that 'tis plain he is unwilling to have him. He laies it upon his weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and he thinks thereby to come off the better: I <hi>cannot</hi> repent, ſaith he, and 'tis true, God ſaith ſo too: and I <hi>cannot</hi> pleaſe God, and God ſaith ſo too, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 8. and yet this ſhall not excuſe him; for there is a <hi>will not,</hi> with his <hi>cannot.</hi> If he were on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly weak, and <hi>deſirous</hi> to come, and did not oppoſe and reſiſt the motions and ſtrivings of the Spirit, and the calls of Grace, 'twere ſomething; if he were faithfull in the uſe of that natural Power that he hath, though indeed he wants a ſpiritual Power, 'twere ſomething. But alas! he doth not like Chriſts terms, and Chriſts yoke; his <hi>will</hi> is againſt them.</p>
               <pb n="72" facs="tcp:64298:47"/>
               <p n="4">4. You are guilty of the <hi>love</hi> of ſin; not only of ſinning, but of <hi>loving</hi> of ſin. By your not cloſing with Chriſt, you declare that you have ſome beloved Luſt or other which you cannot indure to part with; and <hi>that</hi> takes up thoſe affections and that delight which ſhould be ſet upon Chriſt. Sirs, tho I cannot ſee nor ſearch your hearts, yet thus much I know of that which is within you, that you who ſtand out againſt Chriſt, have ſomething in the Throne that ſhould not be there. There is, as ſure as can be, ſome darling-reigning ſin; if there were not, Chriſt and you would quickly make up a Match. <hi>Obj.</hi> But how can you tell this, ſince you don't know our hearts? <hi>Anſw.</hi> Why, we know it, becauſe God hath told us ſo in his Word, that 'tis by reaſon of ſome unmortified ſin that people don't cloſe with Chriſt; they have boſom'd up ſome dear corruption or other. I ground it upon that Scripture in <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 24. <hi>They that are Chriſts, have crucified the fleſh, with the affections and luſts.</hi> Mark, if this be a ſign that perſons are come to Chriſt, That the fleſh with the affections and luſts are crucified in them; then the reaſon why they don't come to Chriſt, is becauſe there are uncrucified affections and luſts in them;
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:64298:47"/> they have ſome Idol in their hearts, to which they bow down and worſhip. And therefore, let me allude to that Scripture, <hi>Act.</hi> 3. 14. where <hi>Peter</hi> is dealing with the Jews about their ſtanding out againſt Chriſt, <hi>But ye denied the holy One, and the Juſt, and deſired a murderer to be granted unto you.</hi> Beloved, every unmortified reigning luſt is a <hi>murderer,</hi> a <hi>murderer</hi> of your ſouls; and now, what's the reaſon that you don't own and cloſe with this holy and juſt One, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt? Why, 'tis becauſe you deſire that this <hi>murderer</hi> ſhould be granted unto you: As the People there in <hi>Matth.</hi> 8. 32. with 34. that they might keep their Swine, they beſought Chriſt <hi>that he would depart out of their coaſts.</hi> So you would keep your ſwiniſh Luſts.</p>
               <p n="5">5. You will be guilty of <hi>Pride.</hi> Oh, in what pride of heart do you walk, that reject the Grace of GOD! You have high thoughts of your ſelves; certainly you take your ſelves to be what you are not, as Chriſt ſaith to them of <hi>Laodicea,</hi> Rev. 3. 17. <hi>Thou ſayeſt, I am rich, and increaſed with goods, and have need of nothing: and knoweſt not that thou art wretched, and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable, and poor, and blind, and naked.</hi> Pray give me leave to be free with you: Why,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:64298:48"/> Sirs, you that ſtand out againſt thoſe Calls of Grace, why are you ſo proud? Soul, what art thou, that thou lookeſt ſo coy upon Jeſus Chriſt? I would fain have thee underſtand thy ſelf a little: Why, I pray thee conſider, what Portion is Jeſus Chriſt like to have with thee, if he ſhould have thee? What canſt bring to him? Canſt thou bring any thing to him but a broken, ruin'd, undone condition? 'Tis true, thou haſt a deal of thine own, but what is it? A <hi>deal of ſin,</hi> a <hi>deal of miſery,</hi> a <hi>deal of deformity,</hi> a <hi>deal of poverty:</hi> If theſe things will make thee rich, thou haſt enough of them; but as for any thing elſe, thou haſt it not, nothing at all to render thee deſirable or lovely in Chriſts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> eyes: and yet doth he offer love to thee, and woo thee as heartily, as if thou wert ſome great and excellent perſon, and hadſt rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, and beauty, and worthineſs, (tho, alas! if ever he have thee, he muſt clothe thee from top to toe) And yet, wilt thou refuſe him? why, I marvel at thy Pride! You know, 'tis counted an odious thing by the common Proverb that goes among us, to be <hi>Poor</hi> and <hi>Proud:</hi> ſo ſinner, what, art ſo Proud, and yet art ſo Poor! The Lord in mercy ſhew thee what thou art.</p>
               <pb n="75" facs="tcp:64298:48"/>
               <p n="6">6. You will be guilty of <hi>Cruelty</hi> to your ſelves. I might ſtand upon that of Cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to us the Miniſters of Chriſt, who take all this pains with you, <hi>as though God did beſeech you by us, to pray you in Chriſts ſtead to be reconciled unto God.</hi> Beloved, if we ſhould ſpend our ſtrength and ſpirits (as we do) in earneſt intreaties of you to cloſe with Chriſt, and you ſhould not be perſwaded, would you not ſhew in this, a great deal of hardneſs of heart againſt Chriſt's Embaſſadors, in ſuffering them to weary, and wear out themſelves in plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with you to repent, and believe the Goſpel, and all in vain? I tell you, the account of this will lie heavy upon you another day; that you ſhould let our Strength, and Spirit, and Labours run to waſte. You muſt needs think, that the pains that the Miniſters of Chriſt take with you in this kind of work, are very ſpend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their outward man: their Strength is not the ſtrength of Stones, nor their Fleſh of Braſs; therefore, there ſhould be ſome pity towards them, and you ſhould not, by your delays and backwardneſs to imbrace their Meſſage, put a kind of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity upon them, even to lay out them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves beyond their ſtrength.</p>
               <pb n="76" facs="tcp:64298:49"/>
               <p> But now, to come nearer to you; What Cruelty do you ſhew to your ſelves, by not cloſing with Chriſt? Saith <hi>Wiſdom</hi> (that is Chriſt himſelf), <hi>Prov.</hi> 8. 36. <hi>He that ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth againſt me, ſinneth againſt his own ſoul.</hi> The great hurt of all, is that which you do your ſelves: by refuſing of Chriſt, you are with your own hands making weapons of Death to deſtroy your ſelves. If you would ſtudy which way in all the World to do your ſelves the greateſt miſchief, 'tis in this, to neglect <hi>this great Salvation.</hi> I tell you, In this you take the ſhorteſt cutt that can be, to manifeſt that you have no greater enemy than your ſelves: And this is the reaſon why the Lord will condemn at the laſt day, every Chriſt-refuſing ſinner, for <hi>ſelf deſtruction.</hi> Oh, Sirs, you are not in a right ſenſe ſelf-lovers, till you are Chriſt-receivers. 'Tis true, you have a car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ſelf love; but that's but a love to ſin, 'tis not a love to the ſoul: and therefore, 'tis not the right ſelf-love, which teacheth one to look after ones own everlaſting Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, next to the Glory of GOD.</p>
               <p n="7">7. You'll be guilty of <hi>undervaluing the higheſt mercies.</hi> Conſider, you are offered as precious things as God himſelf can give to his Creatures: what can he give more
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:64298:49"/> than Himſelf, and his Son and Spirit, his everlaſting Love, and everlaſting Life, his Pardon, his Promiſes? Why, you'll be found deſpiſers of all theſe, if you don't come to Chriſt. And what, is it nothing in your account to be a Child of God? to have all your ſins blotted out? to be juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, and ſanctified, and ſaved? Is it no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to be delivered from the curſe of God, and the wrath to come? Methinks you ſhould be dealing with your own thoughts a little thus: Why, what? ſhall I let theſe great things go? a <hi>great</hi> God, and a <hi>great</hi> Saviour, and a <hi>great</hi> Reward? Certainly, Friends, if you <hi>undervalue</hi> theſe things, 'tis becauſe you <hi>overvalue</hi> other things; you overvalue your ſins, and you overvalue the world, and you overvalue your own righteouſneſs. If you could but count theſe loſs, you would count Chriſt to be gain, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 7.</p>

<pb n="78" facs="tcp:64298:50"/> and upon this account, we are glad to ſee every one of you here, hoping that you will be willing to liſt your ſelves into the number of Chriſt's true Diſciples: and now, what, won't you be ſincere?

                  <hi>Wherein is handled the</hi> third Branch <hi>of the Doctrine,</hi> viz. <hi>That</hi> it is every ones duty to look after a ſhare in this Freedom.</head>
               <p>THe third Branch of the Doctrine (which I now come to) is, That <hi>it is every ones duty to look after a ſhare in this Freedom, by getting a particular and perſonal Intereſt in it;</hi> that ſo we may be of the Corporation or Society of thoſe whom the Son hath made free. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I go any further, I would ſhew a little, that this is our duty, though we be never ſo great ſinners. The greatneſs of your ſins muſt not hinder or diſcourage any of you from looking after it: you muſt not ſay, It is in vain for me to think or hope that ever I ſhall have it, who am ſuch a grievous ſinner. The Lord humble thee that art ſuch a grievous ſinner, and make thee as ſenſible of it as thou haſt need to be. My work is not to go about to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade thee to the contrary, but rather to
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:64298:51"/> aſſure thee that it is ſo indeed. And if thou ſpeakeſt ſo from thy heart, and from an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſenſe and feeling of the burden of ſin, 'tis well. There be many grievous ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, that are not grieved with their ſins: great <hi>ſinfulneſs</hi> and great <hi>inſenſibleneſs,</hi> is the general condition of the World; but as great a ſinner as thou art, thou muſt look after this Freedom. The greater ones Sickneſs is, the more need to ſend for the Phyſician. Do not thou conclude thou ſhalt never be free, becauſe thou art ſo much in bondage; whatever comes of it, <hi>look out</hi> for Deliverance. Pray mark; There be two things that we are greatly to take heed of, about the grace of God by Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That we don't <hi>deſpiſe</hi> it. Oh! how many be there, that make no more of Chriſt and Salvation by him, than they do of a ſtraw? 'Tis wonderful to ſee, how the moſt do caſt all the things of God behind their backs: and the reaſon why they do ſo, is not becauſe there is no worth in the things, but becauſe they do not ſee the worth of them. But I do but name this.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That we don't <hi>deſpair of it,</hi> whatever our ſins have been. The truth is, amongſt thoſe whom we preach to, there be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:64298:52"/> near ſo many of this latter ſort, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> there be of the firſt. Oh! there's a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of deſpiſers and ſlighters of Chriſt and his Freedom: theſe may go where they will, for any thing that many care for them. But becauſe ſometimes we may meet with one here and there, that will be ready to ſpeak in a very diſcouraged way, as if it were to no purpoſe at all for them to look out for this Freedom, by reaſon of the greatneſs of their ſins: therefore I would ſay a little, to take away this hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſsneſs that ſome may have in them. As,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That this Freedom was <hi>intended for ſinners,</hi> and grievous ſinners, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 6. <hi>In due time Chriſt died for the ungodly.</hi> Ver. 8.—<hi>While we were yet ſinners, Chriſt died for us.</hi> 1 Tim. 1. 15. <hi>Christ Jeſus came into the world to ſave ſinners.</hi> Luk. 19. 10. <hi>The Son of man is come to ſeek and to ſave that which was lost.</hi> You ſee 'twas intended for them that were <hi>ungodly,</hi> for <hi>ſinners,</hi> for them that were <hi>lost.</hi> God <hi>ſent</hi> Chriſt to be Saviour to ſuch; and Chriſt <hi>meant</hi> ſuch in what he did in the work of Redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption. If we had been without ſin, we ſhould not have needed that Chriſt ſhould have died for us: why then ſhould our ſins hinder us from looking out for this Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:64298:52"/> ſince the aim, and thoughts, and heart of Chriſt was towards us to do us good, upon this very conſideration, that we were thoſe that lay in a ſinful and loſt eſtate; and that there were divers of us, to whom God did bear an everlaſting love, and ſo ſuch of us were given by the Father to Chriſt, to be redeemed out of that miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable condition. <hi>Obj.</hi> But you'll ſay, Chriſt intended all this for Believers; and they are none but Believers that ſhall have the good of what Chriſt hath done. <hi>Anſ.</hi> That's very ſure, <hi>He that believes ſhall be ſaved, and he that believeth not ſhall be dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,</hi> in reſpect of what they were to be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards: So 'tis none but Believers that ſhall reap the ſaving benefit of his Redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption; but at firſt, and in reſpect of Chriſts dying for them, they were Sinners before they were Believers; and ſo Chriſt dyed for them, not as Believers, but as they were Sinners; tho 'tis true, 'twas as they were <hi>choſen Sinners,</hi> and ſo to be <hi>made Believers.</hi> [I know, that what I am now hinting, would give me a very fair opportunity to ſhew you, that therefore Chriſt did not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentionally die for <hi>all</hi> Sinners; and that the Doctrine of <hi>univerſal Grace</hi> or <hi>Redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption</hi> is to be taken heed of. But if any
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:64298:53"/> deſire it, I had rather give them ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in private, if they pleaſe to bring their Objections, than needleſsly to ſpend time about it now, ſince I do not know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther any of you that hear me, are of that Perſwaſion.] That which I now drive at is, that your ſins muſt not diſcourage you from labouring after a ſhare in this Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, ſince Chriſt was intended for <hi>Sinners,</hi> tho not for <hi>all</hi> Sinners. Thou that art a great Sinner, art in the very caſe for which Chriſt was ſent to give Salvation to; and thy Miſery ſhould not make thee deſpair of a Remedy, but ſtir thee up to look out for it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If thou art a great ſinner already, then thou ſhouldſt not make thy ſelf a greater ſinner, which hopeleſsneſs will do. It is the fruit of deſpair, that it makes him that is very ſinful, to be always grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing worſe: There is leſs and leſs hope of one that caſts away hope; and many would ſooner be recovered, if they did not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude they ſhould never be recovered. A deſpairing ſoul is going on to further wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs: I will give you two notable Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures for it, <hi>Jer.</hi> 2. 25. <hi>Thou ſaidſt there is no hope. No, for I have loved ſtrangers, and after them will I go.</hi> And <hi>chap.</hi> 18. 20.
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:64298:53"/> 
                  <hi>And they ſaid there is no hope, but we will walk after our own devices, and we will every one do the imagination of his evil heart.</hi> What was their ſtrong reſolution to go on in their ſins grounded upon? What made them, that as bad as they were, they would ſtill be worſe? Why, they ſaid, <hi>there is no hope.</hi> Oh! however thou haſt ſinned, don't ſhut up the door of Mercy againſt thy ſelf; for then thou openeſt the door wide to more ſin ſtill. There's nothing doth more harden the heart, than deſpair doth; the more this is is increaſed, the more ſin is ſtrengthned. A deſpairing ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner will grow a deſperate ſinner; he will not care how much he ſins. They that think they have ſinned themſelves paſt mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, will fill up their ſins apace. 'Tis the hope of finding mercy, that muſt bring us back to the fear of God; without that, a man will caſt off all at once, and think that he cannot ſin too much. And no doubt, this is that which makes ſome in the world to be ſo exceedingly prophane as they are, and to be the wonders of the Age they live in, for monſtrous iniquity, that they carry themſelves as if they were turned into de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils, and would even dare God to damn them. Why, 'tis like, if one could ſee
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:64298:54"/> how 'tis within them, that they have, through God's juſt Judgment upon them, a ſecret miſ-giving of heart that they ſhall never be ſaved, they have taken up that deſperate Concluſion, and thereupon they harden themſelves to exceſſive ungodlineſs, and live as tho they had bid defiance to all ſober Converſation. That perſon blocks up his own way to repentance for ſin, that caſts off the hope of being forgiven. See <hi>Pſal.</hi> 130. 4. <hi>There is forgiveneſs with thee that thou mayeſt be feared.</hi> That which brings us to the fear of God, is the hope of finding <hi>forgiveneſs</hi> with him. And therefore 'tis a very ſad thing, and much to be prayed againſt, to be delivered up to a hopeleſs heart; and they that have provoked God by ſinning much already, do provoke him more by deſpairing of mercy.</p>
               <p n="3">3. 'Tis all one to Free Grace, whether thou art a great ſinner or a little one. God can pardon abundantly, tho thou haſt ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed abundantly: do but forſake thy ſins, and then, need as much pardon as thou wilt, thou ſhalt have it, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55. 7. The infinite mercy of God knows well enough what to do with a great ſinner: that's a notable place, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 20. <hi>Where ſin abound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:64298:54"/> grace did much more abound.</hi> Mark what words are here; he doth not ſay barely, where there was ſin <hi>committed,</hi> but where ſin <hi>abounded;</hi> nor only, there grace was <hi>manifeſted,</hi> but there it <hi>abounded,</hi> yea, and abounded <hi>more</hi> than ſin abounded, yea and <hi>much</hi> more. 'Tis much that a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner can ſin, but 'tis more that God can pardon; <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1. 18. <hi>Though your ſins be as ſcarlet, they ſhall be as white as ſnow: though they be red like crimſon, they ſhall be as wool.</hi> He makes but a <hi>though</hi> of ſcarlet and crimſon ſins: he brings it in twice with that word <hi>though, and though;</hi> as if he ſhould ſay, My mercy is not poſed for all this. Whatever Mercy will do, it doth it without difficulty. You know, there be ſome things that you can do with eaſe; ſmall matters you make nothing of them: but then there be ſome other things, that though you can do them, yet 'tis difficulty; you muſt put out all that is in you, all your skill and all your ſtrength: but ſo needs not God to pardon the greateſt ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; that is, he can do it with eaſe. In ſome ſenſe, it is harder to God to puniſh, than it is to pardon. When he comes to puniſh, he ſpeaks as if 'twere hard to him, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 11. 8. <hi>How ſhall I give thee up, O</hi>
                  <pb n="88" facs="tcp:64298:55"/> 
                  <hi>Ephraim,</hi> &amp;c. But when he comes to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, 'tis ſpoken of him as if that were eaſie, <hi>Mic.</hi> 7. 18. <hi>who delighteth in mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy:</hi> and what we <hi>delight</hi> in, we do with eaſe.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Tho thou art a great ſinner, yet thou art not a ſinner in <hi>hell;</hi> thou art a ſinner upon earth ſtill. And there is this diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betwixt ſinners upon earth, and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners in hell; that the firſt are yet under hope, while the others are paſt it. It is thy great miſery, that thou art yet among the <hi>unconverted;</hi> but 'tis great mercy, that thou art not among the <hi>damned.</hi> The place in which thou yet art, is the place of <hi>repentance,</hi> and not of <hi>puniſhment.</hi> We muſt look upon no ſinners as paſt hope, that are not paſt this life: Why, thou liveſt yet; Chriſt hath not denounced the final ſentence againſt thee; thou haſt not yet ſtood before his Judgment-ſeat, and heard him ſay to thee, <hi>Depart thou curſed into everlaſting fire.</hi> What is the patience and long-ſuffering of God towards thee for, but to ſhew thee that thy condition is yet recoverable? 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 9. It is enough to anſwer thy deſpairing thoughts, to tell thee, that yet <hi>the Lord waits to be gracious.</hi> Doſt thou not ſee how God doth lengthen out
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:64298:55"/> the thread of thy life day after day? He could ſnatch thee away in an inſtant, but yet he continues thee where thou haſt Calls, and Means, and Opportunities for the good of thy Soul. Why, 'tis not thus with thoſe that are in Hell; they are beyond all help, and beyond all hope; but thou art not, through the riches of the goodneſs of God. The great thing that thou wanteſt, is but a heart to know the things of thy Peace, in the day of thy Viſitation.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The cloſing with this Freedom which Chriſt offers thee, may make thee as <hi>great a Saint,</hi> as now thou art a great Sinner: As it did <hi>Paul;</hi> what a Sinner was he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he cloſed with Chriſt; and what a Saint did he become afterwards? This Freedom will make a ſtrange alteration in thee, if thou getteſt but a ſhare in that. Such is the power and excellency of God's Grace, that where that comes in truth, it turns things upſide down; it makes an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to God, a friend of God; a hater of Goodneſs, to be a lover of Goodneſs, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 17. Art thou a great Sinner now? ay, but don't be out of hope for all that; for if thou once come in to Jeſus Chriſt, thou wilt be a new man. If now thou haſt an hard heart, this Freedom will break
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:64298:56"/> it; if now thou haſt a ſtubborn will againſt God, this Freedom will make thee obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient; there is help in Chriſt againſt all this. It is very obſervable, that many times thoſe who have been the moſt forward for ſin, when the Lord hath wrought ſavingly in them, they have proved to be the moſt forward, and the moſt famous for Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: and God hath had no greater Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of his Glory in all the World, than ſome, who before they were converted, brought him moſt Diſhonour.</p>
               <p>Well; all this now is ſpoken, to take away your hopeleſsneſs, that I may not have this ſtumbling-block in my way, while I would be calling upon you to look out for a ſhare in this Freedom, that any of you ſhould be under deſpairing thoughts about the getting of it, and ſo lye ſtill, and let all be as 'tis. You know, that man will hardly be brought to do much in a thing, concerning which, he deſpairs that it will never come to paſs. I would have you think, that the buſineſs of your Salvation (as great Sinners as any of you are.) is a thing that through Grace may be effected. Why, Sirs, why may you not be <hi>converted?</hi> why may you not be <hi>pardoned?</hi> why may you not yet be <hi>waſhed, and juſtified, and</hi>
                  <pb n="91" facs="tcp:64298:56"/> 
                  <hi>ſanctified in the name of the Lord Jeſus, and by the ſpirit of our God?</hi> Why may not as great Sinners be brought in yet, as have been brought in already? Methinks that Scripture would come in very ſeaſonably here, <hi>Ezr.</hi> 10. 2. <hi>We have treſpaſſed againſt our God, and have taken ſtrange wives of the people of the land: yet now there is hope in Iſrael concerning this thing.</hi> 1. d. 'Tis very true, our provocations againſt God have been very great, and particularly in this, that <hi>we have taken ſtrange wives of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the land,</hi> (which was the ſin that they were now mourning for) yet, let us not ſit down hopeleſs now, and do nothing, and give up all for loſt: there's ſome hope left ſtill; and therefore <hi>(ver.</hi> 3) <hi>Let's make a covenant—to put away all the wives,</hi> &amp;c. So now in your caſe, that are yet under the guilt of ſo many and ſo great iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, yet there is hope; and therefore, ſeek out for this Freedom by Chriſt. See <hi>Zech.</hi> 9. 12. <hi>Turn ye to the ſtrong hold, ye priſoners of hope.</hi> Tho thou art a <hi>priſoner,</hi> yet thou art <hi>a priſoner of hope;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, <hi>turn to the ſtrong hold,</hi> turn to Chriſt. So that you ſee, I have made way to go on upon this now, to ſhew you, that <hi>'tis every ones duty to look out after a ſhare in</hi>
                  <pb n="92" facs="tcp:64298:57"/> 
                  <hi>this Freedom.</hi> And there are two things among others, that make this to be your duty.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The <hi>Command of God.</hi> He hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded you to look out after Chriſt and your Souls: Friends, it is the will of him that made you, revealed in his bleſſed Word, that you ſhould come to Chriſt, and cloſe with Chriſt, and not refuſe the great and good things which he offers to you, <hi>Matth.</hi> 17. 5.—<hi>Hear ye him.</hi> Mark 1. 15.—<hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent and believe the Goſpel.</hi> Act. 17. 30. <hi>God commandeth all men every where to repent.</hi> Heb. 12. 25. <hi>See that ye refuſe not him that ſpeaketh,</hi> &amp;c. And as all the other Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of God are backed with Promiſes to them that obey them, and with Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings to thoſe that do them not: So 'tis to be obſerved, in a ſpecial manner, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this Command of looking after Chriſt, and believing in him, with what precious Promiſes it is accompanied to thoſe that cloſe with Chriſt, and with what heavy Threatnings to thoſe that reject him. The <hi>Command</hi> it ſelf, you may take one place more for, which ſpeaketh the fulleſt of any yet; 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 23. <hi>This is his command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that we ſhould believe in the name of his Son Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Now for the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes,</hi>
                  <pb n="93" facs="tcp:64298:57"/> they are ſo many that do belong to this, that I cannot name them all: See <hi>Act.</hi> 10. 43. and 13. 39, 40. for a taſte: And for Threatnings, <hi>Act.</hi> 3. 22. <hi>Prov.</hi> 1. 24. to the end: but only that the laſt <hi>verſe</hi> is a Promiſe of everlaſting ſafety to them that receive him. We ſhould therefore much awe our hearts with the ſtrict Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands that are about looking out for Chriſt, and hearkning to his Calls, and know, that the not accepting of Chriſt is the moſt damning ſin, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 18, 19. <hi>This is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men love darkneſs rather than light, becauſe their deeds were evil. The</hi> condemnation, as if there were none but this: And this ſin of not believing in Chriſt, is ſuch a great ſin, that when the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt comes to work upon the heart, he doth, as it were, ſingle out this in a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal manner, to charge that upon the Conſcience, and to reprove and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince for that to be ſure, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16. 8, 9. And this is a ſin which we muſt, and ſhall be moſt humbled for, if ever God intend mercy to us: and whatever other ſins we are ſmitten for, till the heart comes to be ſmitten for <hi>this,</hi> we fall ſhort of thoſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions which the Spirit uſeth to give in,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:64298:58"/> in order to a true Converſion. Tho I don't ſay, that this is always the firſt ſin that the Spirit of God ſets before the Soul, and wounds it for (many times a man's inward trouble begins from ſome other ſins); yet ſooner or later, the guilt of this Unbelief is diſcovered to ſuch a ſoul, and from the ſight of that, it is brought to the deepeſt and the trueſt ſorrow, <hi>Zech.</hi> 12. 18.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The obligation that lies upon you, even by the very light of Nature, to look after <hi>ſelf-preſervation.</hi> Indeed there is a <hi>ſelf</hi> that we muſt not look after the preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of, but do all that we can to bring it to deſtruction; our <hi>ſinful-ſelf,</hi> or our Sins and Luſts, which are as dear to us, by corrupt nature, as our ſelves; this we muſt be ſworn enemies to, <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 5. <hi>Mortifie your members which are upon the earth,</hi> &amp;c. And the reaſon is, becauſe this is not the <hi>right ſelf:</hi> our ſins are the Devils Bratts, and therefore they muſt be daſh'd againſt the walls; there muſt be no ſparing of them, no pleading for their life; for if you give ſin its life, you'll loſe your own: as the Prophet told <hi>Ahab</hi> from the Lord, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the King of <hi>Syria,</hi> that great ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of the children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> when the Lord had delivered him into <hi>Ahab</hi>'s hand, and
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:64298:58"/> he out of favour to him had let him eſcape, when he ſhould have deſtroyed him, 1 <hi>Kin.</hi> 20. 42. <hi>Becauſe thou haſt let go out of thy hand a man whom I appointed to utter de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction; therefore thy life ſhall go for his life,</hi> &amp;c. So thus it will be to all you that ſpare your ſins, and ſtroak them, inſtead of ſtriking them; and becauſe they bring you a little pleaſure to the fleſh for the preſent, therefore they muſt be let alone. God hath put many opportunities into your hand for the deſtroying of them; every time you come to hear, you have, as it were, an advantage given you again: but it may be, that you ſo love this painted ſtrumpet, and are ſo overcome by the flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries of it, that it is as Death to you to part with it. Well Soul, if thou wilt not have ſin to die, thou muſt die; if thou wilt not be the death of that, that will be the death of thee. But there is another <hi>ſelf,</hi> the <hi>true ſelf,</hi> or your ſelves as you are God's creatures, that you are bound to look after the preſervation of; that is, to ſpeak plainly, you muſt take care that you don't go the way to be eternally loſt, and to have Soul and Body caſt into hell. And if you are ſo careful, as you know you uſe to be, to preſerve your ſelves from the
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:64298:59"/> evils of this World, you do all that you can to keep your ſelves from Pains, and Priſons, and Poverty; why, will it not follow, that you ſhould be as careful, yea and much more (becauſe the Soul is more precious) to keep your ſelves from the <hi>everlaſting pains,</hi> and the <hi>everlaſting priſon,</hi> and the <hi>everlaſting undoing?</hi> Well then, you muſt look out for this Freedom by Chriſt, for otherwiſe theſe things will certainly come upon you, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 36. <hi>He that believeth not the Son, ſhall not ſee life, but the wrath of God abideth on him.</hi> And therefore, that man or woman that refuſes Chriſt, is not only no friend to Chriſt, but ſuch are no friends to themſelves, they have not the ttue <hi>ſelf-love</hi> in them, they don't love their own Souls. 'Tis ſaid of the Prodigal when he began to repent, he <hi>came to himſelf,</hi> Luk. 15. 17. He was gone from himſelf, the true ſelf before: but when he returned, then indeed he came to look out after ſelf-preſervation.</p>
               <p>Well now, to proceed upon this Third Branch more throughly, <hi>That it is every ones duty to look after a part in this Freedom:</hi> I will, 1. give you an obſervable thing about it. 2. Shew you the reaſons and grounds why every one is to do this. 3. Make application.</p>
               <pb n="97" facs="tcp:64298:59"/>
               <p> To the 1. There is one thing that is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry obſervable about this in the Scripture, which I would commend unto you; and that is, That Chriſt, in the offers of his Grace, doth not only ſpeak in a general way to all in common, as if he ſhould ſay, Here 'tis <hi>amongſt</hi> you: but in many places he comes to offer it in a <hi>particular</hi> kind of Language, as if he had to deal with per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons ſeverally and apart one from another, and were ſingling of them out one by one: to teach us, that <hi>every particular perſon muſt own it as his great duty, to look after Chriſt, and the Benefits that come by Chriſt for himſelf.</hi> See <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. 10. Mark how particularly Chriſt ſpeaks here: <hi>Jeſus anſwered and ſaid unto her, [i. e.</hi> the woman of <hi>Samaria] If thou kneweſt the gift of God, and who it is that ſaith to</hi> thee, <hi>Give me to drink,</hi> thou <hi>wouldst have asked of him, and he would have given</hi> thee <hi>living water.</hi> So <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 18. <hi>I counſel</hi> thee <hi>to buy of me gold tried in the fire, that</hi> thou <hi>mayest be rich; and white raiment, that</hi> thou <hi>mayest be clothed, and that the ſhame of</hi> thy <hi>nakedneſs do not appear; and anoint</hi> thine <hi>eyes with eye-ſalve, that</hi> thou <hi>mayest ſee.</hi> So <hi>verſ.</hi> 20. <hi>If</hi> any man <hi>hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to</hi> him, <hi>and will ſup with</hi> him, <hi>and</hi> he <hi>with</hi>
                  <pb n="98" facs="tcp:64298:60"/> 
                  <hi>me. q. d.</hi> There muſt not be one of you, but muſt each for himſelf be labouring for a ſhare in theſe things.</p>
               <p>Now for the reaſons of this, I deſire that you would ſeriouſly mind theſe four fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Every one ſhould labour to have a ſhare in the Freedom, becauſe <hi>every one hath had ſhare in the Bondage;</hi> as the Apoſtle ſaith, in <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 12. <hi>Death paſſed upon</hi> all <hi>men, in that</hi> all <hi>have ſinned.</hi> There's none of us can ſay concerning this Freedom, as <hi>Paul</hi> did concerning his being a partaker of the <hi>Roman</hi> Freedom, <hi>Act.</hi> 22. 28. <hi>But I,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>was free-born.</hi> They that have this Freedom, are ſaid in Scripture to be <hi>made free;</hi> they are not <hi>born free,</hi> but <hi>made</hi> ſo, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 18. So in the Text, <hi>If the Son ſhall make you free.</hi> Now ſuppoſe, Belov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that there were a company of People in the World, that had been all of them in great diſtreſs, or that they had been all taken by the Turks, and put to miſerable ſlavery, that never any poor Creatures had a harder condition than they; and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that it had been one of you that were of this number, that had a fellowſhip with them in their bitter Bondage: And that
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:64298:60"/> ſome merciful Prince, that knew of the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable caſe that theſe wretches were in, ſhould be willing, by the paying of a great Ranſom, to redeem them; and he layes down that which is demanded by him that held them in ſlavery, and ſo ſets this Company at liberty: at which, Oh, how their hearts rejoice! Only there is one amongſt them that won't accept of this favour, though his Captivity was as great as others, and he was as fair for deliverance as the reſt; he that ſet the other free, would have done it for him too, if he would not have been willful; but for his part, he would not have his liberty, he would lye and periſh in his thraldom. Why, what a fool and mad-man would he be counted, that would have his part in all the affliction which that Company hath indured, but would have none of their Redeemers kindneſs? Now, Sirs, you may go travel over all the World, and not find ſuch an inſtance as this for the Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage of the Body: but we need not go far to find many ſuch inſtances for this Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage of the Soul. Oh, how many be there that have been partakers of the Curſe, that don't look after the Bleſſing! that have been <hi>Satans ſlaves,</hi> but won't be the
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:64298:61"/> 
                  <hi>Lords free-men!</hi> that had rather be <hi>ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers</hi> and <hi>foreigners</hi> ſtill, than to be <hi>fellow-citizens with the Saints, and of the houſhold of God?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 2. Becauſe <hi>no man muſt reſt in the general offers of Grace, without a particular application of all to himſelf.</hi> The general offers of Grace are like the hearing of ſome excellent Medicine, that is good for them that are under ſome dangerous Diſeaſe: now, 'tis not the hearing of this that will cure; but he that would have good by it, muſt get it for himſelf, and take it, and make uſe of it. You know, tbo there be never ſo good a Plaiſter upon the Table for the healing of a Wound, it may be the Salve of which 'tis made, is the beſt in the World for ſuch a purpoſe; yet that won't help at all, if it be not applyed and laid on. So now, if you do not look after a particular ſhare in this Freedom, to bring it home to your own Souls, you do but reſt in the general notions of Grace. This is but the Plaiſter upon the Table, as it were; 'tis too far off to do you any good; thou haſt nothing for thy ſelf all this while. You know, there's a great deal of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betwixt a mans ſaying, This is a brave Houſe, and, This Houſe is <hi>mine.</hi> So there
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:64298:61"/> is a precious Chriſt, and precious Freedom, and precious Promiſes; yea, but are they <hi>thine?</hi> Art thou one of them that can ſay, they are given <hi>to us?</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 4. <hi>Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by are given unto us exceeding great and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious promiſes.</hi> Mark, he doth not ſay barely, theſe exceeding great and precious Promiſes are <hi>given,</hi> but given <hi>to us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that you don't come nigh enough to Chriſt, and the Benefits by Chriſt, if you don't get them for your ſelves. 'Tis the great ſin of Men and Women, that they ſit down in things at large about Chriſt: they know, and ſay, and read, that <hi>Chriſt came into the World to ſave ſinners,</hi> and <hi>to ſeek and to ſave that which was loſt.</hi> Ay, 'tis moſt true; yet what are you the better for all this, unleſs this Salvation be yours? And how can it be yours, without your labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to make it yours?</p>
               <p>Beloved, there be many that are, and will be undone for ever, becauſe they went no further than the hearing of a Chriſt at a diſtance. Now thoſe that ſhall be ſaved by him, he and their ſouls have been brought <hi>nigh</hi> together, and they make ſuch an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of him to themſelves, that the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation they have to him, is like that of the Members to the Head, or of the Wife to the
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:64298:62"/> Husband; they are ſo joined to him by Faith, that they become one with him: now the general offers of Grace never make us one with Chriſt; till he is my Chriſt, I am ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver united to him. Now this is the great thing that you ſhould look after, to have Union with Chriſt, and 'tis application that makes the Union; and you have nothing of him in a ſaving manner, till you are <hi>in</hi> him, and he <hi>in</hi> you, <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 27.—<hi>Chriſt in you the hope of glory Obj.</hi> It may be ſome will ſay, that have but ſmall cauſe for it, Oh, if it be Faith that makes Chriſt mine, why then, I have a part in him; for I do believe (I thank God) in my Saviour Jeſus Chriſt; I put my whole truſt in him with all my heart. <hi>Anſ.</hi> Thoſe that have the true Faith, have been made to ſee that there is a falſe Faith, a counterfeit Faith; yea and to fear, and queſtion, and examine whether their Faith were not a counterfeit Faith. Beloved, there is a counterfeit of every Grace; and certainly, there be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that think they believe, and don't. As I would have no child of God to think he doth not believe, when he doth; ſo I would have no Chriſtleſs perſon to think he doth believe, when he doth not. The way to find out the truth of our Faith, is to put
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:64298:62"/> our Faith to the proof: have you not ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken it for granted that you have Faith, without trying it? I'll give you but two Notes of the true Faith, and I am ſure they'll be enough to prove divers to be Unbelievers, that think themſelves to be Believers.</p>
               <p>The true Faith is always accompanied with <hi>love to Chriſt,</hi> with a high prizing love to him; they that believe with their hearts, they ſet their hearts upon Chriſt; he hath their deareſt and choiceſt affections placed upon himſelf; they have diſcerned ſuch a Beauty in Chriſt, that they cannot but love him beſt, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 7. <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto you that believe, he is precious.</hi> Now there be many of you that think you have Faith, and yet let one liſten never ſo much to you, one cannot hear you talk of Chriſt, nor utter any long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings or breathings of Soul after him; and when the beauty, and ſweetneſs, and fulneſs, and freeneſs of Grace that is in Chriſt is ſpoken of, you have no delight to be upon ſuch a Diſcourſe. And pray now, what do your thoughts and deſires run out moſt upon? Are not your minds and affections taken up with the preſent and periſhing things of this World, more than with Chriſt? Is there not ſomething that ſits nearer to
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:64298:63"/> your hearts, than he doth? Surely here's a diſcovery of a falſe Faith, to ſay one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves in him, and yet not love him. Ask thy ſoul, Haſt not gone many a day, many a week, many a year, nay all the days of thy life, and had never one raiſed deſire towards him? Thou doſt not know what 'tis to be unſatisfied without his preſence, and without communion with him: thou doſt not know what 'tis to be ſick of love for him: he may ſtay never ſo long from thy Soul, and thou never grieve nor groan: thou canſt do well enough with the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, though thou haſt not Chriſt. I tell thee, if it be ſo, thou haſt thy Faith to ſeek: thou never madeſt any particular ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of him yet to thy ſelf; for if thou hadſt, application of him would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get affection to him. A true Believer is greatly in love with the Lord Jeſus; he had rather be without any thing than him, he accounts all loſs in compariſon of him, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 8.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The true Faith is always accompanied with <hi>likeneſs</hi> to Chriſt. A Believer in him, is a Conformer to him, and a Follower of him; he bears about Chriſt's Image in the World, he lives according to Chriſt's Life, and according to Chriſt's Law, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:64298:63"/> to Chriſt's Example; he partakes with him in his crucified and in his quickned State: As <hi>Paul,</hi> in <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 20. when he ſpeaks that the life of faith was in him; in the beginning of the <hi>verſe,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>I am crucified with Chriſt;</hi> he died to ſin, and walked in newneſs of life. But now, how many be there of you, that think you have Faith, and yet are as much for ſin as ever you were, and as contrary to good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs as ever you were? you can be as vain, and as vile, and as carnal, and as covetous, and as proud, and paſſionate, and lukewarm, as ever you were. If it be thus with thee, I tell thee, if there were no better Believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers than thou art, there would not be one true Believer in the World. A Faith that doth not change thee into a new Creature, is a falſe Faith; 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 1.—<hi>To them that have obtained like precious faith with us.</hi> How doth he make out, that they had this <hi>precious faith?</hi> why, <hi>verſ.</hi> 4. they had <hi>eſcap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the corruption that is in the world through luſt.</hi> True Faith is of a ſanctifying, puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying nature; <hi>It is at peace with no ſin, nor at war with any duty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 3. We ſhould every one look after this Freedom, becauſe <hi>a diligent looking out for it, is the way to obtain it.</hi> You know
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:64298:64"/> how much diligence hath done ſometimes in other caſes; how it hath, by the bleſſing of God upon his Labours, raiſed a man to great Riches, that before had nothing; yea, it may be, was worſe than nothing. So if you would be diligent, how can you tell but that you may be rich, tho you are now ſo very poor? and that you may be made free, tho for the preſent you are in Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage? Why may not a man get a ſpiritual Eſtate by taking pains, as well as many have gotten an earthly one?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> Oh, but you'll ſay, there are ſome diſcouraging places that I meet with in the Scripture. <hi>Anſ.</hi> Well, What are they? let us hear. And before thou goeſt any further, let me tell thee, it is a great miſtake to think, that there is any place of Scripture rightly underſtood, that doth diſcourage any Soul from taking pains to look after his own Salvation. Doth not God every where almoſt, call upon People to do it? Is not the Word full of Precepts to that purpoſe, and full of Promiſes to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe? Take but one place among many, <hi>Matth.</hi> 7. 7, 8. <hi>Ask, and it ſhall be given you; ſeek, and ye ſhall find; knock, and it ſhall be opened unto you. For every one that asketh, receiveth; and he that ſeeketh, find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth;
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:64298:64"/> and to him that knocketh, it ſhall be opened.</hi> Well, I pray thee, let's hear thy diſcouraging Scriptures. <hi>Obj.</hi> Why, there are eſpecially two places that ſeem to put me quite out of heart. What be they? Why, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 16. <hi>So then it is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that ſheweth mercy. Anſ.</hi> This is not to take a man off from Endeavours, or to diſcourage him in them; but only to ſhew, that a man muſt not put his Salvation up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Endeavours, as the chief Cauſe of it. What would all his Endeavours be, if God had not Mercy on him? When we have done all, 'tis the Mercy and free Grace of God that any of us are ſaved. Well, what's the other Scripture? Oh, a ſad one! <hi>Luk.</hi> 13. 24. <hi>Strive to enter in at the ſtrait gate: for many, I ſay unto you, will ſeek to enter in, and ſhall not be able.</hi> Why then, I were even as good not <hi>ſeek</hi> it; <hi>Many ſhall ſeek to enter, and ſhall not be able. Anſ.</hi> Why ſure, this is no diſcouragement againſt Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours now; but this is to ſhew us, how it will be hereafter, at the laſt day, with them that do not now endeavour, and now ſtrive: why, time will come, that they will <hi>ſeek to enter in, and then they ſhall not be able.</hi> This is plain from the Context; ſee
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:64298:65"/> 
                  <hi>verſ.</hi> 25. Well therefore, here's no diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement, but a call to diligence. Now this ſame diligent looking out for this Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom doth conſiſt, 1. In uſing the <hi>means:</hi> You muſt be inquiring: Would I come to ſuch or ſuch an end, why, what's the way to it? And then when you know what the Means are, you muſt uſe them. 2. In uſing <hi>all</hi> the Means, you muſt try every way to be ſaved. 3. In doing all in <hi>obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to God:</hi> why this is my duty, here I am bid and bound to wait. 4. You muſt put forth <hi>all your ſtrength</hi> and care in the uſing of the Means: you muſt not do it by halves, neither in regard of the <hi>means,</hi> nor in regard of the <hi>pains.</hi> 5. You muſt do it with perſeverance and continuance; give not over. 6. You muſt look to God for a bleſſing upon the Means.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 4. We ſhould every one look af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a ſhare in it, becauſe, <hi>nothing will ſtand in ſtead, but the having an intereſt in this Freedom:</hi> 'tis ſuch a <hi>one thing needful,</hi> that no man can have help or ſuccor any other where. Now he may think, that this and that will ſerve his turn, and that he ſhall not periſh, becauſe he truſts in a company of lying vanities; but he will at laſt find all his carnal refuges to fail him, and he
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:64298:65"/> will be left deſtitute of any thing to fly to, that will be ſufficient to ſave him from the wrath to come. Oh, Beloved, there is a dreadful day of God's fiery indignation drawing near; in which, all the wrath that ever was poured out upon the World, from the beginning of it to this hour, is but a drop, in compariſon to that Ocean of vengeance that then ſhall ſwallow up the children of diſobedience: and he that would then have his houſe to ſtand, had need have it <hi>well built,</hi> and laid upon a <hi>ſure foundation,</hi> for 'twill be tryed to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 13. Well now, I would a little aſſure you before-hand (that you may be wiſe in time) that nothing will ſtand you in ſtead but an intereſt in Chriſt and his Freedom.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Not all your <hi>worldly Enjoyments.</hi> If a man hath been never ſo great, and rich, and honourable in the World, if he hath had his Table ſpread every day with the fineſt Food, and his Body covered with the fineſt Cloath; if he hath laid up Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of Gold, and Silver, and Jewels; if he had as many Pearls of his own as there be piles of graſs upon the ground, this would be nothing: the whole World, if you had it, cannot keep you from periſhing, if
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:64298:66"/> you have not a part in this Freedom, <hi>Prov.</hi> 10. 4.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Again; <hi>No pleas or excuſes</hi> that Chriſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs perſons make. Now they have many vain excuſes, why they do not look after Chriſt and their Souls, <hi>Luk.</hi> 14. 18, 19. One's excuſe is, that he <hi>wants time,</hi> he is ſo full of buſineſs: another he pleads, that he is not <hi>book-learn'd:</hi> another, why Lord help him, he is poor; rich Folks, and thoſe that need take no care for the things of this World, they may mind good things: and another, that he hath <hi>ſuffered</hi> ſo much in this World, that he hopes he ſhall not ſuffer hereafter: and another, he hopes that <hi>he that made him will ſave him,</hi> &amp;c. and another, tho he ſwears an Oath now and then, or tells a Lye, yet he is <hi>ſorry</hi> for it, God forgive him. Oh, but theſe fig-leaves which thou haſt ſewed together, will not cover thy nakedneſs when the Lord appears, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 28. 17.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Again; <hi>No Gifts</hi> which God hath en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed you with. Tho you have the gift of <hi>Knowledge,</hi> and the gift of <hi>Prayer,</hi> or a Miniſter the gift of <hi>Preaching,</hi> as <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. 22. God may make a great deal of uſe of you, while you are here; and yet, if you have not an intereſt in Chriſt, he will damn you at laſt.</p>
               <pb n="111" facs="tcp:64298:66"/>
               <p n="4">4. Again; No <hi>particular Opinion</hi> that you have taken up. It may be one may think, that becauſe he is for the <hi>Epiſcopal</hi> way, which he judges to be right, therefore now he ſhall be ſaved: Another, becauſe he is for the <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> or <hi>Independents,</hi> or <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> way, which he judges to be right, therefore he ſhall be ſaved. No, be of what Opinion thou wilt, or of what Way thou wilt, if thou haſt not an Intereſt in this Freedom by Chriſt, thou art a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd man, thy Opinion won't ſave thee. The Phariſees they thought that they could not but be ſaved, becauſe they were of that Sect: but when God came to work upon <hi>Paul,</hi> he made him ſee, that 'twas not his being a Phariſee would do his buſineſs, tho he was one of the ſtricteſt ſort among them; but he muſt have the righteouſneſs of Chriſt, or he was undone.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Again; No near <hi>relation</hi> to thoſe who have been, or are the <hi>people of God.</hi> It may be, thou haſt been the Child, or the Brother, or Siſter of them that feared God, of the ſame Blood with them after the Fleſh: but for all this, thou muſt go to hell, if thou haſt not a part in this Freedom. <hi>Mary,</hi> that was the Mother of Chriſt, you know, was very nearly related to him, he lay in
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:64298:67"/> her Womb; but that would not have been enough that he was born of her Body, if he had not been born in her heart. It would not ſerve the turn of the <hi>Jews</hi> that they were <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Seed, and the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of his Fleſh; but they muſt be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of his Faith in Chriſt too, or elſe they could not be bleſſed. <hi>David</hi> did not count it enough, that he could tell God that he was <hi>the Son of his Hand maid,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs he could tell him that he was his <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant</hi> too: and he puts this firſt, to ſhew, that the other would have done him no good, unleſs he had been intereſted in Chriſt himſelf, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 116. 16.</p>
               <p n="6">6. No <hi>religious or godly Education</hi> that you have had. It may be, you have been brought up in the Families where there hath been much of God and Goodneſs ſet up; yea, perhaps you have ſpent all your days in the company and communion of the Saints: and yet at laſt you muſt have your eternal abode and portion with Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, if you have not a part in this Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. <hi>Iſhmael</hi> was brought up in a good Family, in the Family of <hi>Abraham,</hi> of whom God ſaid, <hi>I know him, that he will command his children and his houſhold after him,</hi> Gen. 18. 19. And yet, for want of this
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:64298:67"/> Freedom, he was rejected, and ſo was <hi>Eſau.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7. No <hi>moral Virtues</hi> that you have lived in. It may be, thou haſt been a civil Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, an honeſt Perſon, a chaſt Perſon, a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber Perſon; perhaps never wronged any Body by unjuſt Dealing, never told a Lie, never ſwore an Oath, never diſguiſedſt thy ſelf by Drunkenneſs, never defiledſt thy Body with Uncleanneſs: it won't do thee a jot of good for the ſaving of thee from Hell, if thou haſt no part in this Freedom, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. 20. Thou muſt have a righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that exceeds this, even the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Chriſt by Faith, or elſe Heavens door will be ſhut againſt thee.</p>
               <p n="8">8. No <hi>profeſſion</hi> that you have made of the Goſpel of Chriſt, tho to a very high degree. Tho thou haſt outwardly ſeemed to be a very zealous and forward Diſciple of his, haſt worn his Livery, and haſt been baptized in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghoſt; tho thou haſt often in the Sacrament, eaten of that Bread that ſignifies his Body, and drank of that Wine that ſignifies his Blood<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet if thou haſt not this Freedom, 'tis nothing; 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 12. <hi>He that hath not the Son of God, hath not life,</hi> let him profeſs what he will of him.</p>
               <pb n="114" facs="tcp:64298:68"/>
               <p n="9">9. No <hi>good thoughts</hi> that the People of God have had of you. It may be thou haſt been taken for a true Child of God; no body ſuſpects thee of Hypocriſie; thou art current Gold by their Weights: yea, but if thou haſt not a part in this Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, when thou comeſt to be weighed in Gods Ballance, thou wilt be found want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p n="10">10. No <hi>ſufferings</hi> that you have met with for Conſcience-ſake. Tho thou haſt thus ſuffered, yet thou muſt ſuffer again, and that for ever, if thy Conſcience be not purged from dead works by the Blood of Chriſt; as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 1. that <hi>tho he gave his body to be burned, if he had not charity, it profited him nothing.</hi> No more would it thee, if thou haſt not Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="11">11. Again; No <hi>bitter cries</hi> or earneſt intreaties that you ſhall at laſt make to God, for the eſcaping of his wrath. Oh! when Chriſt is juſt ready to pronounce the Sentence againſt thee, what a lamentable ado wilt thou make that it might not be paſt? but if thou haſt not a part in this Freedom, all thy wringing of hands, and falling upon thy knees, will be in vain.</p>
               <p n="12">12. Once again; Not <hi>all the mercy</hi> that
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:64298:68"/> is in God. Tho God hath an infinite Ocean of mercy, yet it won't be for thee, if thou doſt not look after this Freedom, <hi>Luk.</hi> 19. 27. As there is no miſery to the Saints, ſo there is no mercy to the wicked beyond this life.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 1. This then ſharply reproves the great ſlothfulneſs of the World, in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of their Souls. 'Tis every ones duty to look after a ſhare in this Freedom, and yet almoſt every body is idle: the whole earth is quiet and at reſt; Oh, how little ſtirring is there for an Intereſt in Chriſt! What <hi>Pharaoh</hi> ſaid of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> in their Bondage, I am ſure may be ſaid of Sinners in this Bondage; <hi>Exod.</hi> 4. 17. <hi>Ye are idle, ye are idle.</hi> Oh! what cauſe is there now that I ſhould preach with tears, to bewail the lamentable careleſsneſs of people about their everlaſting Concernments! The good Lord of his infinite mercy be in the midſt of us at this time, by the power of his Spirit, to convince you that are out of Chriſt, of this great ſin, and to humble you for it. I offer my ſelf now, in Gods Name, to plead with you about your woful ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gligence in not looking after this Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, which you have heard is every ones duty to look after, and therefore 'tis yours.
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:64298:69"/> There is Freedom to be had by Chriſt; but pray now, you that are in your ſins, what have you done to get it? Oh! what would many of you do to get the World? How would you ride and run, and riſe ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and go late to bed for a gainful Bargain, or great Eſtate? You are ſo forward and eager, ſome of you, for the things of this World, that you are like a high-metall'd Horſe, you can hardly be held in; Chriſt is fain, as it were, to call from Heaven to bid you ſtop, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55. 2. <hi>Wherefore do ye ſpend your money for that which is not bread? and your labour for that which ſatisfieth not?</hi> You'll try all ways, and turn every ſtone to ſee what may be done for a part in theſe <hi>uncertain Riches,</hi> though it may be you ſhall never get them, when you have done your utmoſt; and if you do, you may leave them as ſoon as you have them. Why, but Sirs, is there not another life? and are there not better things? and have you not precious Souls to look after? and is it not high time for ſome of you, by courſe of nature, to think of removing to Eternity, and of being in a fitneſs for Death and Judgment? And yet, ah, Lord! you live, as to ſpiritual things, as if you had nothing to do. Upon theſe accounts, the
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:64298:69"/> Scripture ſets you forth as perſons that are <hi>ſtanding ſtill; Why ſtand you here all the day idle?</hi> Matth. 20. 6. and as perſons that have their <hi>hands in their boſoms,</hi> Prov. 19. 24. and as perſons that are <hi>aſleep upon their beds,</hi> Prov. 6. 9. The children of God, if there be any of them that live about you, or among you, they are, as 'twere, all of a trembling, for fear they ſhould fall ſhort of Heaven, and fail of the Grace of GOD, tho they are not like you, to let all run at random; <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 12. But you, tho your Sins be unpardoned, and your Souls uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, and nothing is ſet at rights between God and you; yet you ſet neither your Hand nor your Heart to any good thing. Why now, is this the way to do well? Dare you think that you are going to happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs under all this remiſsneſs? Do you believe, that <hi>ſtrait is the gate, and narrow is the way that leadeth to life, and few there be that find it?</hi> What, have you no <hi>talent</hi> to <hi>trade with</hi> for the glory of God, and the good of your own Souls? If you have not <hi>five,</hi> nay if you have not <hi>two,</hi> have you not <hi>one?</hi> Sure thou haſt one Talent at leaſt: God gives every one ſomething to be doing withall; why, but what doſt thou with it? What doſt thou do with thy
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:64298:70"/> Time, with thy Strength, with thy Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, Reaſon and Judgment? What doſt thou do with thy Body? and what doſt thou do with thy Soul? What, haſt thou received all theſe, to put them to no good uſe? Is there ſo great a work to do as thou art told of in every Sermon thou heareſt, and thou falleſt to nothing of it? Well then, here's thy ſin, but where's thy ſhame? Art not aſhamed of this ſlothful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs now? No wonder indeed that thou art yet in ſuch a woful condition, and thou letteſt all alone: Well may the fire burn the houſe to the ground, when he that dwells in it doth nothing to quench it. Oh, Sin and the Devil will play <hi>Rex</hi> in thy Soul, that meet with no reſiſtance. Three things I would briefly leave with you, to go a little further upon this Uſe.</p>
               <p n="1">1. 'Tis true, <hi>you cannot do all that you ſhould.</hi> You ſhould be new Creatures; and you ſhould repent and believe: but this is God's Workmanſhip, and God's Gift and Grace, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 7, 8, 9. No man goes thus far by any power of his own, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6. 44. <hi>No man can come to me, except the Father which hath ſent me draw him.</hi> The truth is, you think you can do theſe things, but you are deceived: you promiſe
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:64298:70"/> ſometimes to do theſe things in your <hi>own ſtrength;</hi> if you did not think ſo, you would look to God in your promiſes, and go to God for power to perform it; but you mind not that. And what makes you put off this work to hereafter? you are not for repenting <hi>preſently,</hi> nor for coming to Chriſt <hi>preſently,</hi> but you ſay, you <hi>will</hi> do it tho: Why, this ſhews, that thou thinkeſt thou <hi>canſt</hi> do it. When a man puts off a buſineſs, I'll do it at ſuch a time, ſaith he; he thinks he can do it when he will, elſe he would not put it off, but go in hand with it now. But you are deceived, you cannot do it of your ſelves; for the work of Grace is <hi>above</hi> the power of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: 'tis too high for Nature to reach it; nay, corrupt Nature is <hi>contrary</hi> to Grace: Yet,</p>
               <p n="2">2. You <hi>can</hi> do, what you <hi>do not:</hi> you <hi>can</hi> forbear many ſins that you commit, as to ſuch a paricular Action and Time. I have known ſome that would ſwear hard among their Companions, yet in the preſence of one that they knew would reprove them, they could bite in their Oaths; and you <hi>can</hi> outwardly perform many Duties that you neglect: and therefore, you muſt look that God will judge you for neglecting
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:64298:71"/> them. You <hi>can</hi> put your ſelves under the Means, and you <hi>can</hi> come to hear the Word, and lend attention to it; and if you will, you <hi>can</hi> remember ſomething that is preached, and think and ſpeak of it when you go home: You <hi>can</hi> ſet up reading the Scripture, and praying morning and even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in your Families; you <hi>can</hi> get acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with thoſe that fear God, and need not be ſuch ſtrangers to them, unleſs you would your ſelves. You <hi>can</hi> ſend for a good Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter, if you will, to your Houſe, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point him a convenient hour to come, wherein your ſelves and family may be free to attend to thoſe Inſtructions, which you, if you will, <hi>can</hi> deſire him to give you. You <hi>can</hi> reprove one another for ſwearing, or lying, or taking the Name of God in vain. You <hi>can</hi> ask your ſelves ſome ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous queſtions in private, about your Souls condition; Do I hate ſin? Do I love God? Have I a part in Chriſt? Am I fitted for Death and Judgment? And you <hi>can</hi> beg of God (in words) to make you better; and many more things you <hi>can</hi> do. And therefore,</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>You ſhould do what you can.</hi> There is a deal muſt go to your Salvation, that no leſs than an Almighty Arm can bring to
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:64298:71"/> paſs; and very like, if thou wer't ſtirring, God would put forth his power, and come in with ſupernatural Grace and Aſſiſtance: I would have you to hope he would. But why do not you do what you <hi>can?</hi> Here's your ſin; and how can you expect that he ſhould help you to do what you <hi>can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not,</hi> if you do not what you <hi>can?</hi> You do in ſome meaſure put your ſelves into the way of Gods enabling you, when you do ſet that natural power a work which you have, as reaſonable Creatures: as the man, that though he could not put himſelf into the Waters, where there was Cure for thoſe that were diſeaſed; yet he lay at the Pool. Yea, tho thou ſhouldſt not get Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation at laſt (which thou haſt no juſt ground to be hopeleſs of) yet, thou ſhouldſt do what thou canſt, if it were but to leſſen thy Condemnation, and that thou mighteſt not ſink ſo deep into the Torments of Hell, as otherwiſe thou wilt: for he that hath received a Talent, and wraps it up in a Napkin, and puts it to no good uſe, will thereby greaten his everlaſting miſery; <hi>Matth.</hi> 25. 30. <hi>Caſt ye the unprofitable ſervant into outer darkneſs: there ſhall be weeping and gnaſhing of teeth.</hi> Who is this unprofitable ſervant? Why,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:64298:72"/> 
                  <hi>verſ.</hi> 25. the wicked and <hi>ſlothful</hi> one, that did not do what he could; he is caſt into outer darkneſs, the worſt place of all.</p>

                  <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 2. Then if every one ſhould <hi>look after a ſhare in this Freedom,</hi> to get it for himſelf, this ſhews us, the <hi>fulneſs</hi> that is in Chriſt. If <hi>every one</hi> would come to him, he hath enough for them: he keeps ſuch a good houſe, that he can ſatisfie all that are hungry; in this houſe there is <hi>room enough</hi> to hold you, though you come <hi>never ſo many,</hi> Luk. 14. 22. and <hi>bread enough</hi> to feed you, tho you come <hi>never ſo empty,</hi> Luk. 15. 17. The reaſon why any Soul periſheth, is not becauſe Chriſt is attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with any wants, but becauſe they that were bidden would not come. As for himſelf, he hath enough to ſave as many Worlds, as are Souls that ſhall be ſaved. And therefore, you that are come to Chriſt, make no ſpare of him; feed upon him, and fear no lack; he hath a Fountain that can never be drawn dry, an Eſtate that can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be ſpent. <hi>All the fear is, whether you'll feed enough upon Chriſt; not whether Chriſt hath enough to feed you.</hi> But I ſhall not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large upon this. And ſo I have done with the third Branch of the Doctrine.</p>

               <head type="sub">
                  <hi>Wherein the Fourth Branch of the Doctrine is handled; namely, That</hi> this Freedom comes by Chriſt.</head>
               <p>THE Fourth Branch of the Doctrine is, <hi>That this Freedom comes by Chriſt; If the Son ſhall make you free.</hi> Whoever is made free, is made free by Chriſt; 'tis he doth it, wherever it is done. In the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying on of this, I ſhall do theſe five things: 1. I ſhall ſhew, when this Freedom that is in Chriſt did begin to be of force. 2. What this intimates to us, that <hi>our Freedom comes by Chriſt.</hi> 3. How it doth appear that this Freedom comes by Chriſt. 4. After what manner this Freedom is in Chriſt. 5. I ſhall make Application.</p>
               <p>To the 1. <hi>When this Freedom that is in Chriſt did begin to be of force;</hi> I anſwer, Immediately upon the <hi>fall</hi> of mankind. It is a great miſtake to think, that this Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom did not begin to be of force <hi>till Chriſt came in the fleſh.</hi> If that were ſo, then all
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:64298:73"/> that died before that time, would have died in their ſins. 'Tis true, when Chriſt came, there were ſome things about this Freedom that were not before: As,</p>
               <p n="1">1. It <hi>was more clearly manifeſted.</hi> They before us had it in <hi>ſhadows,</hi> and <hi>types,</hi> and <hi>figures:</hi> the deliverance of the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> out of the bondage of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and then a long time after out of the bondage of <hi>Babylon,</hi> did point at this; and all the <hi>ceremonial Worſhip</hi> and Sacrifices did look this way, ſignifying, that there was one to come that ſhould redeem them to God by his Blood: and all the good and benefit of thoſe things that were then obſerved in thoſe Miniſtrations, lay only in this, that they did lead them to Chriſt who was held forth in them, tho in a more dark and obſcure manner. Yea, but when Chriſt came, this Freedom was <hi>brought unto light;</hi> for then he appeared, who was the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of all; and then when the <hi>ſubſtance</hi> came, the <hi>ſhadows</hi> ceaſed.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It was <hi>more largely extended.</hi> Before, this Freedom was kept within the bounds of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Nation, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 147. 19, 20. 'Twas a great priviledge then, to be one of that People, becauſe <hi>ſalvation was of the Jews,</hi> and all the reſt of the World were
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:64298:73"/> Strangers and Foreigners: But when Chriſt came, then the other Nations, poor Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then and Gentiles, had this Salvation ſent to them. The Lord now <hi>makes his way to be known upon earth, and his ſaving health among all nations.</hi> But for all this you muſt know, that this Freedom was in force ever ſince the <hi>fall;</hi> for then God made the Promiſe of ſending Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>the ſeed of the woman ſhould bruiſe the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents head,</hi> Gen. 3. 15. and all that were ſaved, were ſaved in the way of looking to that <hi>promiſed Seed,</hi> though he was not to come into the World till <hi>the fulneſs of time.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I muſt needs deſire you to take notice of four things from hence, That this Freedom hath been of force ſince the Fall. As,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That <hi>perſons, not living in the days wherein Chriſt was upon Earth, is no hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drance at all to their eternal Salvation;</hi> for many are ſaved, both before his coming in the Fleſh, and ſince his aſcending into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, who never ſaw him in his bodily pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence. I confeſs it would have been a very deſirable thing, to have ſeen our dear and bleſſed Saviour here in our Nature; and to have had the priviledge to have converſed
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:64298:74"/> with him about the things of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God; and to have heard him that <hi>ſpake as never man ſpake.</hi> But we are hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred neither from Grace nor Glory for the want of this; we may be <hi>ſanctified</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it, and we may be <hi>ſaved</hi> without it. As for <hi>ſanctification,</hi> many that did ſo ſee him, did remain unſanctified; and People were not converted by the Humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Chriſt, but by the Divine Power and Spirit that dwelt in him, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6. 63. And as to <hi>ſalvation,</hi> that's obtained, not by beholding Chriſt with an eye of <hi>Fleſh,</hi> but with an eye of <hi>Faith;</hi> and they who have that eye, here's their comfort, Though they never ſaw Chriſt upon Earth, they ſhall ſee him in Heaven. If thou hadſt ſeen him upon Earth, thou wouldſt have ſeen him in the <hi>form of a ſervant,</hi> in a poor and mean condition (for then he came to hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble himſelf, and to be of no reputation) but 'twill be another manner of ſight to ſee him in Heaven, to behold his glory there, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17. 24.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>That there were Believers, and as great Believers, in the days of the Old Teſtament, as there are in the New.</hi> Believing was the way to Salvation then, as well as now. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe this <hi>Freedom</hi> by Chriſt did not then
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:64298:74"/> begin, when Chriſt came in the Fleſh; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you muſt think, that Faith in Chriſt did not then begin neither. Believing was the old and the only way to Heaven, ever ſince the Covenant of Works was broken all in pieces by <hi>Adam</hi>'s Tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. Indeed there have been more Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers ſince the times of the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, than formerly; becauſe the Goſpel hath been propagated further: but there were as true and as great Believers before, as you may ſee, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. where the Faith of <hi>Abel,</hi> and <hi>Enoch,</hi> and <hi>Noah,</hi> and <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> and the reſt, is recorded and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded as an Example to us. And if there were ſuch eminent Believers then, how ſhall we anſwer it if we be Unbeliev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers now, who have greater helps for our Faith than they had? It ſhould much ſtir us up to believe, to conſider what times we live in; how many things we have to help our Faith, of that they had: they had the Promiſes of Chriſt <hi>made,</hi> but we have them <hi>fulfilled;</hi> they were fain to ſpell out Chriſt in a heap of Ceremonies, but we may read him in his own Story.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Take notice of the <hi>wonderful Virtue</hi> that is in Chriſt; ſuch a Virtue as reaches from the beginning of the World to the
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:64298:75"/> end of it. You ſee his Freedom was of force in the firſt Generation, and ſo it ſhall be to the laſt. You know, that Chriſt ſaid, when the woman that had the bloody Iſſue touched him, <hi>I perceive that virtue is gone out of me.</hi> But Oh, what a deal of virtue is there gone out from Chriſt in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, that he hath been the Redeemer of Souls from the entrance of Time, and will be ſo till Time ſhall be no more. Things may be very precious when they are made, and for a while after, as cordial Waters, and curious Ointments, and coſtly Perfumes; but they won't always keep their Virtue, and eſpecially if they ſtand open, it will not be long before they be corrupted: but Jeſus Chriſt is ſuch an excellent Cordial, and ſuch an excellent Ointment, that tho he hath been ſo long ſtanding open for the uſe of every comer to him, yet he hath not loſt any thing of his Virtue or Savour; he is as refreſhing and as ſweet ſtill, as evet he was. You find in <hi>Solomon's</hi> time, in the Old Teſtament, how he ſpeaks in <hi>Cant.</hi> 1. 3. <hi>Becauſe of the ſavour of thy good ointments, thy name is as ointment poured forth; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore do the virgins love thee.</hi> What a <hi>ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour</hi> Chriſt ſent forth to the People of God then! and in 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 7. in the times
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:64298:75"/> of the New Teſtament, ſtill Chriſt held his Virtue; he was precious to them that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, and ſo he is ſtill. A Believer can be refreſhed and comforted with Chriſt, (he is ſo full of Virtue ſtill) when he can be refreſhed and comforted with nothing elſe: 'tis the preſent experience of the Saints in this Age, as well as in the Ages that are paſt, That Chriſt can revive a drooping Soul, and chear up a fainting Spirit now, as well as ever he could.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Take notice of the <hi>exceeding riches of the grace of God,</hi> that upon ſuch a thing as the Fall, he ſhould bring in Freedom by Chriſt. Oh! what an aſtoniſhing Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration is this, that God ſhould take oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to manifeſt his higheſt Mercy, where he might have taken occaſion to have ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted his hotteſt Juſtice! What could have been expected, in all likelihood, when our firſt Parents, and we in them, had thus by ſin ſpoiled all God's Workmanſhip, and defaced his bleſſed Image to which we were conformed in our Creation, but that he ſhould have left us to all the miſery that his broken Law could expoſe us to? And lo! no ſooner had man undone himſelf, but he brings in a promiſe of Redemption by Chriſt. Who would ever have thought,
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:64298:76"/> that Mercy would have come in at that door? Behold, Sirs, at what ſtrange doors God can bring Mercy in: when the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition looks like a hopeleſs, loſt, undone condition, God can let in Mercy there. If it be <hi>great affliction,</hi> nay if it be <hi>great tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion,</hi> God can let Mercy in for all that, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 13. 9. <hi>O Iſrael, thou haſt deſtroyed thy ſelf, but in</hi> me <hi>is thine help.</hi> There Mercy comes in, but at what a ſtrange door 'tis! And therefore, whatever be thy caſe, or whatever be thy guilt, don't ſay, Well, to be ſure Mercy can never come in here. 'Tis true, we muſt look for Mercies coming in the appointed ways of finding it, and we muſt not expect it at any ſtrange door. Don't tempt the Lord, and preſume upon hopes of Grace in ways of ſin, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 1. <hi>What ſhall we ſay then? Shall we continue in ſin that grace may abound?</hi> I only note this from it, That when God will, 'tis won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull to ſee what ſtrange occaſions he takes to ſhew himſelf gracious.</p>
               <p>To the Second thing, what is intimat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to us by this, <hi>That Freedom comes by Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. It intimates the <hi>horrible nature of ſin,</hi> in that no leſs than <hi>God</hi>'s <hi>own Son</hi> muſt be the Redeemer from it. You know ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:64298:76"/> the greatneſs of a Diſeaſe is ſeen in the greatneſs of the Phyſician that comes to the Patient. If one ailes but ſome ſmall or ordinary matter, why, then one will hope to do well again, either without any Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician at all, or elſe that an ordinary Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician will ſerve the turn: But when there comes ſome famous eminent Doctor, one that all the Countrey hath been laid for, to inquire out a man that is ſo skilful and able in his Profeſſion, that there is not ſuch another to be heard of; why, then People will be ready to ſay, Certainly the perſon that this Phyſician goes to, is taken with a very dangerous Diſeaſe, and his condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is no ordinary Diſtemper, becauſe there is ſuch an extraordinary Phyſician ſent for. So here, that the <hi>Son of God</hi> muſt be ſent into the World to recover it; that there muſt be a <hi>Phyſician from Heaven</hi> to do this Work: Oh! it ſpeaks what a grievous condition ſin brings us into. Sin is the worſt of evils: one bad better be any thing for Affliction, than be a Sinner; yea, the greateſt ſuffering is not compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to the leaſt ſin. And therefore, you that will not believe that ſin hath any ſuch great harm in it, you muſt needs think you are deceived, if you do but conſider what
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:64298:77"/> a Phyſician this makes work for: See <hi>Pſal.</hi> 41. 4. If thou hadſt committed but one little ſin in all thy life, yet 'tis of ſuch dangerous conſequence, that thou wilt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly die of it, if this Doctor <hi>Jeſus</hi> do not come to cure thee.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That <hi>ſpiritual Freedom is an unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Mercy:</hi> you may ſee 'tis, in that it comes by Chriſt, by ſo great a hand. Do you think, that the Son of God ſhould come down from Heaven to beſtow it up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us, if it were not ſome tranſcendent good thing? There are many excellent Mercies that are given to men, and yet there's no coming from Heaven to give them; the Gifts come from Heaven, but the Giver doth not, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1. 15. but this is ſuch a Gift, and ſuch a Mercy, that the Giver muſt come from Heaven to give it, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16. 28. Oh, Sirs! what high thoughts ſhould we have then of this Freedom? Surely there's abundance of worth in it; (as I ſhall ſhew upon the laſt Branch of the Doctrine) in that it comes to us by ſuch a Meſſenger as Chriſt himſelf. You that have a part in this, you may ſay as <hi>Paul</hi> doth, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 15. <hi>Thanks be unto God for his unſpeakable gift.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="133" facs="tcp:64298:77"/>
               <p n="3">3. That Chriſt hath a <hi>ruining deſign upon the Kingdom of the Devil.</hi> If <hi>Freedom</hi> comes by him, then <hi>that</hi> muſt not ſtand. This <hi>Freedom</hi> by Chriſt, is God's device and contrivance, to batter down the Devil's walls, to turn his Subtilty into Fooliſhneſs, and his Power into Weakneſs, and to bring away his Subjects from him in ſpight of his heart, even as many as the Lord will have to be ſaved. 'Tis true, the devil will keep multitudes of Souls in his ſlavery, but there is not one of them that God hath choſen, but ſhall be ſure to be brought out from his Iron Fornace. The Devil may keep thoſe that are to be his own for ever, but he ſhall not always keep any that belong to God; though he hath ſome of them yet in his Dominion, yet they ſhall be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered: as <hi>Pharaoh</hi> had the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> for a while in captivity, but at laſt he muſt part with them whether he would or no, and there remained not one of them left behind. Though they don't come all out in the <hi>ſelf<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>ſame day,</hi> as they did out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> Exod. 12. 41. yet now one is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, and then another is converted, till it ſhall come to that at length, that the Devil hath not one left that was a choſen Veſſel to God.</p>
               <pb n="134" facs="tcp:64298:78"/>
               <p n="4">4. It intimates, that as Chriſt under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took the Work of our Redemption, ſo he did not <hi>fail of accompliſhing</hi> that which he went about. Freedom comes by him; he did not only attempt or indeavour to bring it, but he <hi>effected</hi> it. Men many times they ſet upon great things, but then when they have begun them, they cannot carry them through; the burden, and charge, and care of it is beyond their power: and it is one of the greateſt follies of ſome, that they will be medling with thoſe things that are too high for them. Now this was a very high Undertaking that Chriſt went about, to procure <hi>Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> for ſuch a vaſt number of Souls as were to be brought to Glory: for tho 'tis true, they that ſhall be ſaved are but few, in compariſon to thoſe that ſhall pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh; yet conſidered apart and by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, they are a wonderful great Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, <hi>Rev.</hi> 7. 9. Well, but now as high an Undertaking as this was, 'twas not too high for Chriſt; he began it, and he finiſhed it: See <hi>Joh.</hi> 17. 4. <hi>I have finiſhed the work;</hi> he means, this Work of our Redemption. And in <hi>Joh.</hi> 19. 30. you read, that theſe words, <hi>It is finiſhed,</hi> were the laſt words that Chriſt ſpake before he died: as if he
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:64298:78"/> ſhould have ſaid, Though I am a dying, yet the work of my Life is done. I do not go off the World like a Bungler, that went about what he was not able to effect. All that believe in me will find, that I have not been a <hi>half,</hi> but a <hi>whole Saviour</hi> to them: the buſineſs hath not miſcarried in my hands, that they ſhould wiſh I had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver medled with it. You know, the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle tells the <hi>Coloſſians,</hi> chap. 2. 10. that they were <hi>compleat</hi> in him: and in <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 12. 'tis ſaid, that Chriſt hath <hi>obtained</hi> eternal Redemption for us: he did not only <hi>endeavour</hi> to obtain it, but he hath <hi>obtained</hi> it. The Greek word is, he hath <hi>found</hi> it; he did not do as a man doth ſometimes when a thing is loſt, he ſeeks it, but then he comes back again and ſaith, he cannot find it. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53. 10. <hi>The plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the Lord ſhall proſper in his hand:</hi> that is, he ſhall be ſure to carry it through. 'Tis true, he met with many difficulties in his way; as it was the higheſt Work that ever was gone about, ſo 'twas the hardeſt Work: if it had not been Chriſt that had been about it, it would never have been brought to paſs; but becauſe 'twas he that had it in his hand, therefore he brought it to a bleſſed period. And in this, Chriſt
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:64298:79"/> is an Example to us, not only to begin good things, but to hold out to the finiſhing of them, whatever hardſhip we muſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo. Beloved, difficulty doth attend all Duty, and great difficulties do attend ſome Duties; but for all that, we muſt ſee the <hi>end</hi> of them. God loves ſuch a frame of ſpirit, as to have Chriſtians to be <hi>crowding and preſſing</hi> to Heaven, through many things that ſtand in their way. 'Tis no great matter, you know, to get to a place when one hath Elbow room enough; but when the way is thronged up, and there is this to hinder him, and that to hinder him, and yet the man will not give over till he comes where he ſhould; it ſpeaks that he was reſolved to get thither. And remember this Note, That the going on in our Duty, notwithſtanding difficulty, is an evident ſign of our Sincerity. There was a great deal of difficulty in <hi>Abraham</hi>'s way, when he was to offer up his only Son at the Command of God: but becauſe he would not ſtick, at that, ſee what is ſaid to him, <hi>Gen.</hi> 22. 12. <hi>Now I know that thou feareſt God, ſeeing thou haſt not with-held thy ſon, thine only ſon from me.</hi> As if he ſhould have ſaid, Now thou haſt given a proof it to purpoſe.</p>
               <pb n="137" facs="tcp:64298:79"/>
               <p> You may judge of the Sincerity or Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie of your Hearts in this caſe. You begin many things that are good, it may be; ay but do you carry them on to perfection? Don't you fly back again, when you find 'tis hard? It may be thou beginneſt to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thy ſelf in this and that Sin or Luſt; yea, but as thou art a doing of it, thou find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt that Self-denial is a very hard thing, and ſo thou <hi>returneſt with the dog to his vomit, and with the ſow that was waſhed, to her wallowing in the mire.</hi> Oh! this is a bad ſign that thy heart is not right in the ſight of God, One that is ſincere will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to ſtir himſelf up the more now, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he finds 'tis hard; and he will be thinking, What, ſhall I be worſted, and let alone, becauſe my way is not ſmooth and eaſie for the Fleſh to walk in? And tho he finds it difficult, yet he doth not think it impoſſible; he believes, through Grace, ſuch a ſtrong Corruption may be ſubdued, and ſuch a Temptation may be overcome, and ſuch a great Affliction may be born with a patient ſpirit; and therefore, he will go to God for power, tho he hath none of his own; and go to God to make things eaſie, tho they are ſo hard to him, and then he finds he can go on, <hi>Col.</hi> 4. 13.</p>
               <pb n="138" facs="tcp:64298:80"/>
               <p> To the Third, <hi>How doth it appear that this Freedom comes by Chriſt? Anſ.</hi> For this I ſhall give you two ſorts of Arguments; 1. Some that prove it more directly. 2. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers that prove it more remotely; being drawn from ſuch conſiderations as are not immediately about Chriſt himſelf.</p>
               <p>Thoſe Arguments that prove it more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly, which do more nearly relate to Chriſt himſelf, are theſe.</p>
               <p n="1">1. This Freedom was to come by one that was the <hi>only begotten Son of God,</hi> who could call God Father, and whom God could call his Son, after ſuch a manner as none elſe could: they muſt have ſuch a Relation one to another, as could not, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſome accounts, be communicated to any other. For tho 'tis true, God doth in his rich mercy enter into the Relation of a Father with Believers, and gives them power to become the Sons of God, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 12. Yet (as I have formerly hinted) to <hi>them</hi> God is a Father by <hi>Grace, Covenant and Promiſe,</hi> and they are children to him by <hi>Faith;</hi> ſee 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. <hi>ult. Gal.</hi> 3. 26. But this was not enough for him that was to bring in this Freedom; he muſt not be one that was <hi>made</hi> the Son of God, ſo as to be none before; but he was to have
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:64298:80"/> this Relation to him from all eternity. We cannot expreſs the manner of it, it is ſuch a glorious Myſtery. Well now, who can this be but Chriſt? The Saints, they do not claim their Sonſhip this way, tho they are called Sons, and wonder at it that they ſhould, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 1. Yet they acknowledge, that they were not the Sons of God by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, no, but children of wrath, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 3. They'll quickly tell you, 'twas not their <hi>natural due</hi> to be the Children of God, but to be fire-brands in Hell; for ſo this Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture laſt quoted doth intimate. And the glorious Angels in Heaven, they don't claim their Sonſhip this way neither: they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge that they are Sons by <hi>Creation,</hi> and they all of them praiſe and bleſs the Lord for this, and <hi>ſhout</hi> as it were <hi>for joy,</hi> in ſinging together to his Name, <hi>Job</hi> 38. 7. But Chriſt he hath this Sonſhip by <hi>eternal Generation;</hi> this is the <hi>only begotten of the Father,</hi> as he is often called, and therefore Freedom muſt come by him. And in my Text you may obſerve, that when Chriſt ſpeaks of this Freedom, he puts in this Relation of his to God; he uſeth the word <hi>Son, If the Son,</hi> &amp;c. To teach them, that it muſt needs come by him, ſince he was the eternal Son of God: for ſuch a one
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:64298:81"/> he muſt be, who was to give this Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>
               <p>There is one Objection, before I can go on, that I would take notice of. <hi>Obj.</hi> But it is ſaid in Scripture, that this Freedom, and the Works about it, were to be by a <hi>Servant</hi> of God; which is another Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion than that we are now ſpeaking of, yea and a far more inferior one than this of the Son of God. If a <hi>Servant</hi> of God was to bring this Freedom, how can it be by the Son of God? You ſhall find the places in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53. 11. <hi>Zech.</hi> 3. 8. and elſewhere. <hi>Anſ.</hi> This is none other than the Son of God who is here ſpoken of; only he is called by this name, in reference to the <hi>great Work</hi> that he was to do, and in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to the mean and <hi>low condition</hi> in which he was to do it; <hi>he took upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf the form of a ſervant:</hi> and in reſpect to his <hi>faithfulneſs</hi> in all that he undertook, as the Scripture ſaith, <hi>he was</hi> faithful <hi>to him that appointed him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. This Freedom was to come by one that was to be <hi>God and Man together in one perſon.</hi> He was to be ſuch a wonderful One, that the like was not to be found again, either in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven or Earth. In Heaven there was one that was God, yea but he was not <hi>man;</hi> and upon
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:64298:81"/> Earth there were many that were men, yea but they were not God. But here the two Natures, the <hi>Divine</hi> and the <hi>Humane,</hi> they muſt meet together in him that was to be the Redeemer: and there was great reaſon for it; the procuring of this Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom did require both theſe to concur, and each of them to lend their helping hand. Now thus it was with Chriſt; he was <hi>God,</hi> for he ſaith, <hi>I and my Father are one;</hi> and he was <hi>man</hi> too, for he ſaith, <hi>The Father is greater than I.</hi> And therefore, Chriſt was the wonderfulleſt Sight that ever was beheld upon Earth: to ſee a perſon that was true God and true Man <hi>at once,</hi> what a rare Sight was that? Oh! What an aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing thing is the Incarnation of Chriſt, that God ſhould take upon him humane Fleſh, and that humane Fleſh ſhould be united to the Godhead! Yea, this will make a conſiderable part of the Glory that ſhall be in Heaven, to behold the Son of God in our Nature. What an everlaſting joy will it be to the Saints, to ſee Chriſt in their Nature ſitting down at the right hand of God! Well, therefore, ſurely Freedom comes by Chriſt, ſince 'tis he that is both God and man in one Perſon for ever.</p>
               <pb n="142" facs="tcp:64298:82"/>
               <p n="3">3. This Freedom was to come by one, that was to be <hi>all his days upon Earth with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſin;</hi> he muſt lead as pure a ſpotleſs Life, as the perfect Law did call for: he muſt not do as we do; the beſt of us perform Duties that have a great many flaws, and fail in this and that, and then repent; no, he muſt fulfill all righteouſneſs to a tittle. Why, ſo did Chriſt, and therefore Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom comes by him, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 22. <hi>Who did no ſin, neither was guile found in his mouth.</hi> There was not a Tranſgreſſion in the whole Life of Chriſt; he was without blemiſh and without ſpot; tho he <hi>ſpake</hi> much, yet be never ſpake amiſs; tho he <hi>thought</hi> on many things, yet he never thought amiſs; tho he <hi>did</hi> many things, yet he never did any thing amiſs; he had not only ſincerity, but he had <hi>perfection;</hi> not only holineſs, but <hi>all the degrees</hi> of it. The People of God, tho they have Grace, yet they have need of grains of Allowance; they don't <hi>ſo</hi> their Duty, but that they ſtand in need of mercy; tho God be glorified by that they do, yet they don't look to be juſtified by what they do. But now, Chriſt he liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſo, as that he was <hi>juſtified by works;</hi> yea ſo, as to juſtifie all that believe in him by his works, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 19. He lived ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly,
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:64298:82"/> as that we need not fear to follow his Example: we are commanded to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the Example of the Saints; yea, but we muſt take heed that we don't follow them in every thing, for fear we ſhould follow them in ſin: tho the general courſe of a child of Gods walking is holy and good, yet he hath his particular miſcarriages, and there we muſt leave him: but Chriſt's walking 'twas <hi>all</hi> obedience, and <hi>all</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity to the Will of God; therefore he is a fit and a full Pattern for us, in what is our Duty.</p>
               <p n="4">4. This Freedom was to come by one, who could <hi>make full ſatisfaction</hi> to the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice of God for ſin: for ſo God was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved, that he that would be the Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſer of it, ſhould, without any abate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, bring in ſuch a Ranſom as was able to recompence all the wrong that he had received. And therefore, he had need to be ſome <hi>mighty <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ndertaker</hi> that ſhould ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in this Work; ſince he was to offer up a Sacrifice of ſuch Value, as might make an All-ſufficient Expiation and Atonement to the higheſt Demands that could be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded in a way of Satisfaction. Now if all the Beaſts of the Foreſt, and all the Cattle upon a thouſand Hills ſhould have
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:64298:83"/> been gathered together, and given in Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice to God; yea, if all the lives of Men and Angels ſhould have gone for it: this would not have quieted the Juſtice of God. The guilt of ſin is another manner of thing, than that it can be bought off, or purged away by ſuch means as theſe: no, there muſt one be found, who could bring a more excellent Sacrifice than all Creatures, or any mere Man could amount to. Now, this full Satisfaction Jeſus Chriſt did make, and therefore <hi>Freedom comes by him.</hi> And that he did ſo, appears in three things, which you find in that Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews:</hi> 1. In that after Chriſt had offered up himſelf, all other <hi>Sacrifices ceaſed:</hi> it aboliſhed all the <hi>ceremonial</hi> Worſhip of the Old Teſtament; then there was no more <hi>blood of bulls and of goats</hi> required to be ſhed, nor the <hi>aſhes of an heifer to ſprinkle the unclean:</hi> See <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. Thoſe Miniſtrations and Services were pleaſing to God before, as they did type out his Son that was to come: but when he was come, and had offered up that great Offering of Himſelf, then (mark the expreſſion) God hath <hi>no pleaſure</hi> in them; thou <hi>wouldſt not</hi> have them, ſaith <hi>ver.</hi> 5. He had <hi>no pleaſure</hi> in them, ſaith <hi>ver.</hi> 6. He <hi>takes them away,</hi>
                  <pb n="145" facs="tcp:64298:83"/> ſaith <hi>ver.</hi> 9. <hi>q. d.</hi> Away with them, what ſhould I do with theſe now? He looks upon his <hi>Son in the fleſh,</hi> the <hi>Body</hi> that he had <hi>prepared,</hi> the <hi>ſecond ſacrifice,</hi> as 'tis here called; that is, of another kind and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture than the firſt Sacrifices under the Law were; and that is it that he is for, and that he will now eſtabliſh. Now if Chriſt had not made full Satisfaction, then theſe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Sacrifices ſhould not have ceaſed; there muſt have been the Old Teſtament Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip ſtill: But there is no need of that now; nay, it would be an abomination to God, <hi>now,</hi> to bring him ſuch kind of things as theſe; it would be, as you read in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther caſe, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 66. 3. <hi>He that killeth an ox, would be as if he ſlew a man: he that ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficeth a lamb, as if he cut off a dogs neck: be that burneth incenſe, as if he bleſſed an idol.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. It appears that Chriſt hath made full Satisfaction by this, that he doth <hi>not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue his own offering</hi> up of himſelf: he was to purchaſe this Freedom by the offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up of himſelf. Now, if he had no laid down a full Price, why then, he muſt have gone to his Sufferings again, he muſt have died <hi>often;</hi> as the Sacrifices under the Law, becauſe they were not full, and could
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:64298:84"/> not make the comers to them perfect, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they muſt be renewed; but Chriſt offered up himſelf but <hi>once,</hi> and there was enough: See <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 25, 26. God never ſaid to Chriſt, Son, you muſt die again; this is ſuch a great Debt, that you have not paid enough.</p>
               <p>3. It will be further manifeſt, that he cleared all the ſcore, by this, That when he had offered up himſelf, and roſe again from the dead, he was <hi>received up into glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</hi> Now he could never have come thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther himſelf, nor have brought any elſe thither, if his Satisfaction had not been full; See <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 12. <hi>But this man, after he had offered one ſacrifice for ſin for ever, ſat down at the right hand of God:</hi> that is, in token that he had <hi>made the comers to him perfect;</hi> for ſo you have it in <hi>ver.</hi> 14. If he had not, 'tis certain that he would have been in the Grave ſtill.</p>
               <p>5. This Freedom was to come by one that was to die, <hi>but not for himſelf:</hi> if he had died for himſelf, he had not been fit to die for others. His Death muſt be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together for the excuſing and delivering of thoſe, who for their own Tranſgreſſions had deſerved that the wrath of God ſhould have fallen upon themſelves. He
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:64298:84"/> muſt be a Surety for others, and one that could ſay, <q>I am bound for ſuch and ſuch perſons Debts; and being ſo, I do acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge they are <hi>mine,</hi> and I take them upon <hi>my ſelf,</hi> and here I come to diſcharge them.</q> Why, thus it was with Chriſt, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Freedom comes by him; he laid down his Life, but he tells you, 'twas for his <hi>ſheep, Joh.</hi> 10. 15. He was not indebted a far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing token to God upon his own account: Law and Juſtice had nothing to ſay to him, nor nothing to do with him, but only as he ſtood in our ſtead, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 9. <hi>He was rich, yet for your ſakes he became poor.</hi> Mark, for <hi>your ſakes.</hi> What had he done to offend God? or to ſuffer ſuch a cruel, and pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and curſed death as he did? Let all his Life be ſcanned to the utmoſt, he would have been found innocent, <hi>holy, harmleſs, undefiled, ſeparate from ſinners.</hi> And had it not been for others, in whoſe behalf he indured all that Agony and bloody Sweat which he underwent, it had nor conſiſted with the Juſtice of God to lay ſuch things upon him. But ſince he would put him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in our place, out of his great love to poor loſt ſinners, therefore 'twas fit that God ſhould deal thus ſeverely with him as he did: and 'twas well for us that he <hi>laid</hi>
                  <pb n="148" facs="tcp:64298:85"/> 
                  <hi>on ſoundly</hi> upon Chriſt, and did not ſpare him at all. See that Scripture, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53. 5. <hi>He was wounded for our tranſgreſsions, he was bruiſed for our iniquities, the chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our peace was upon him; and with his ſtripes we are healed.</hi> Mark here, how Juſtice <hi>laid it on</hi> upon Chriſt. <hi>q. d.</hi> What? are you ſtept in to bear theſe blows that ſinners have deſerved ſhould fall upon them? Well, I'll not ſpare you a jot the more, becauſe you are my Son: and then he falls to it in ſuch a manner, as that he <hi>wounded</hi> him, and <hi>bruiſed</hi> him; he <hi>cruſhed</hi> him as it were, <hi>between the milſtones</hi> of his wrath for our iniquities, that he made him the ſaddeſt Spectacle to look upon that ever was. And I ſay, 'twas well for us that Juſtice laſhed Chriſt in this dreadful manner; for, <hi>with theſe ſtripes we are heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:</hi> they were wounding ſtripes to Chriſt, but they are healing ſtripes to us: that Blood that this ſin-revenging Hand fetch'd from Chriſt, turns to be a precious Salve for our grievous Sore. Hence 'tis clear, that Chriſt is the very Redeemer, becauſe 'twas not for himſelf that all this was done to him; See <hi>Dan.</hi> 9. 26.—<hi>cut off, but not for himſelf.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="149" facs="tcp:64298:85"/>
               <p> 6. This Freedom was to come by <hi>one who was witneſſed to by all the Prophets un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Old Teſtament,</hi> and to whom all things were to agree which they foretold: Now thus it was with Chriſt, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Freedom comes by <hi>him.</hi> See <hi>Act.</hi> 10. 43. <hi>To him gave all the Prophets witneſs,</hi> &amp;c. And therefore, you do often meet with this in the Story of Chriſt's Life and Death recorded in the Goſpel; this and that was done, that the ſaying of ſuch and ſuch a Prophet might be fulfilled, and that ſuch a Scripture might be fulfilled; all was ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled in Chriſt. The Prophecies of the Old Teſtament, they foretold out of what Nation he that was to be the Redeemer ſhould ariſe, <hi>viz.</hi> from among the Jews: So did Chriſt, ſaith the New Teſtament. The Prophecies of the Old Teſtament foretold, that he muſt be of the houſe of <hi>David,</hi> and of the tribe of <hi>Judah:</hi> So was Chriſt, ſaith the New Teſtament. That he was to be born of a <hi>Virgin;</hi> So was Chriſt, ſaith the New Teſtament. That the place where he muſt be born, muſt be <hi>Bethlehem;</hi> and there the New Teſtament tells us Chriſt was born. I cannot ſtand to quote Places about theſe and many other things of this ſort: ſtudy the Word for this; compare
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:64298:86"/> Scriptures of the Old and New Teſtament together, you'll ſee how all doth exactly agree to Chriſt. And therefore he is the <hi>true Redeemer;</hi> and this Jeſus whom I preach unto you, is <hi>Chriſt.</hi> But I ſhall go no further in this.</p>
               <p>There are other Arguments that do more remotely prove, that Freedom comes by Chriſt. I will but hint at four.</p>
               <p n="1">1. If it doth not, why then obſerve up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on how many things this would <hi>caſt a lie.</hi> It would caſt a lie upon <hi>all the Miniſtry</hi> that preach the Goſpel: They tell you that Freedom comes by Chriſt, and are, or ſhould be earneſt with you to ſtir you up to come to him for Salvation. What? do you think they are all Deceivers? Have they all conſpired together throughout the World, to put a cheat upon People? Why, how can this be? They never met all together, nor poſſibly could, to plot ſuch a buſineſs. It caſts a lie upon all the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> upon all the <hi>Prophets.</hi> It would caſt a lie upon all the <hi>Ordinances</hi> of Chriſt, for they all lead to him. It would caſt a lie upon the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> for they ſpeak of him. It would caſt a lie upon the <hi>Angels</hi> in Heaven, for they ſang at his Birth, <hi>Glory to God in the higheſt,</hi> &amp;c. It would caſt a
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:64298:86"/> lie upon <hi>Chriſt,</hi> for he told the World that he was the <hi>Redeemer: I am the light of the world;</hi> and <hi>I am that bread of life;</hi> and <hi>I am the reſurrection and the life;</hi> and <hi>I am the way, and the truth, and the life.</hi> Yea, it would caſt a lie upon <hi>God</hi> himſelf; for he ſaid, this was <hi>his beloved Son,</hi> and owned him by a Voice from Heaven.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If Freedom doth not come by Chriſt, then <hi>all the Saints hope is loſt.</hi> They have <hi>all</hi> placed their hope in him, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 2. They hope that they ſhall have eternal life by believing in him; they hope that it won't be long now, before he will come again and receive them to himſelf, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his Promiſe, that where he is, there they may be alſo. They are deſcribed there in <hi>Tit.</hi> 2. 13. to be a People <hi>looking for the bleſſed hope, and glorious appearance of the great God, and our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> And oh, how many breathings and longings of Soul have they, and do they ſend forth to him! and, <hi>having the firſt fruits of the Spirit, they groan within themſelves, waiting for the adoption, to wit, the redemption of the body,</hi> Rom. 8. 23. And what? ſhall all this be <hi>loſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. If Freedom did not come by Chriſt, certainly the Devil would not keep ſuch a
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:64298:87"/> do to hinder Souls from coming to him. He makes this his great buſineſs, <hi>to blind the minds of them that believe not, leſt the light of the glorious Goſpel of Chriſt, who is the Image of God, ſhould ſhine unto them,</hi> 2 Cor. 4. 4. But they might <hi>come, and come</hi> to Chriſt, and he would put forth no power, nor uſe no ſubtilty to hinder them at all, if there were no Freedom to be found in him. The Devil knows 'tis other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe; and therefore he ſets all his devices a work to block up that way.</p>
               <p n="4">4. If Freedom did not come by Chriſt, then <hi>no Soul that comes to him could find reſt in him:</hi> But every Soul that comes to him, finds reſt in him, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. 3. Yea, they find a glorious reſt in him, as God promiſed they ſhould, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 11. 10. <hi>Obj.</hi> Why, but there are many that come to Chriſt, and yet are much diſturb'd, and full of diſquieting thoughts. <hi>Anſ.</hi> Yea, that's true, and yet notwithſtanding they do find reſt in Chriſt; for, ask ſuch a perſon in the midſt of all his fears, It is thus and thus with you, ay, but would you change? Would you place your hope in another? Oh! no: here he deſires to pitch for ever. Well then, he finds <hi>reſt</hi> here, as to the <hi>Objection;</hi> and all his trouble is not,
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:64298:87"/> that he fears whether there be reſt in Chriſt, but whether he be <hi>truly come</hi> to him.</p>
               <p>To the Fourth, After what manner this Freedom is in Chriſt, I anſwer, 1. 'Tis in Chriſt <hi>perſonally; i. e.</hi> Jeſus Chriſt who is the Second Perſon in the Godhead, is he who is our Deliverer and Redeemer. When a poor Creature is delivered by ſome one out of his Slavery, certainly he muſt needs deſire to know who was the perſon that did it. Now the Lord Jeſus Chriſt is the very perſon that hath done this great Work for us; as he ſaid to the woman of <hi>Samaria, Joh.</hi> 4. 26. when ſhe ſpake of the <hi>Meſſias</hi> or Redeemer that was to come, <hi>I that ſpeak unto thee, am he.</hi> Now, the reaſon why I mention this, that <hi>our Freedom is in the perſon of Chriſt,</hi> is in order to the anſwering of one Queſtion that may profitably be propounded here; which is this,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> Whether our Redemption be ſo to be appropriated to Chriſt, the Second Perſon in the Godhead, as that the other Perſons, namely, the Father and the Holy Ghoſt, had nothing, or have nothing to do in it?</p>
               <pb n="154" facs="tcp:64298:88"/>
               <p> 
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Our Freedom comes in ſome reſpects, from the Father and the Holy Ghoſt, as well as from the Son, or from all the three Perſons jointly. 2. In other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects, it comes from Chriſt perſonally and peculiarly; ſo as that, in ſome ſenſe, he is and muſt be looked upon as more imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately our Redeemer. I will open theſe two things a little.</p>
               <p>1. Our Freedom comes from all the three Perſons. That it comes from Chriſt, you know that's the whole buſineſs of this <hi>4<hi rend="sup">th</hi>
                  </hi> Branch of the Doctrine; and much hath been ſpoken to it already. But now for the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> and the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> they are alſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in this Freedom. For the <hi>Father,</hi> ſee that place, <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 12, 23. <hi>Giving thanks unto the Father,—who hath delivered us from the power of darkneſs,</hi> &amp;c. And for the Holy Ghoſt, you read, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 17. that where he comes into the heart, he brings Liberty with him: So that the giving of this Freedom is, in ſome reſpects, the joint work of all the Perſons. I ſhall ſhew you what you are to gather from this by and by, that they all have a hand in it. But, firſt. I will ſhew you what hand the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and the Holy Ghoſt have in conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction with Jeſus Chriſt about this Freedom;
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:64298:88"/> and then how Chriſt, as I ſaid, is more <hi>perſonally</hi> and peculiarly concerned in it.</p>
               <p>For God the <hi>Father,</hi> I ſhall give you five things, for his having a hand in this Work.</p>
               <p n="1">1. He did <hi>appoint,</hi> deſign and chooſe the Son to be our Redeemer: he did in his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Wiſdom and Goodneſs, contrive the way for the bringing of thoſe that ſhould believe, out of the miſery that they were fallen into by ſin, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 4, 5. So that our Redemption was from the Father, as the Original and Fountain of it. He broke, as it were, this Buſineſs to his Son, and by his own conſent he pitched upon him to be the Saviour and Mediator. You may obſerve in many places of the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that the Father is brought in, ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Chriſt as one that he had called and choſen to this Work, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 42. 6, 7. and 49. 8, 9. and 55. 4, 5. and 61. 1. <hi>Zech.</hi> 9. 11. By theſe places you may ſee, that the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and the Son did, as it were, agree to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether from all Eternity about this thing; and took, as I may ſay, a delight to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer together in Heaven about it. There were many wonderful things done between them even there: there this admirable De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign was laid; and there Chriſt, as it were,
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:64298:89"/> ingaged and entred into Covenant with his Father, that he would undertake and faithfully perform this great Work: and there the Father paſt his promiſe to the Son, that thoſe whom he ſhould redeem ſhould have eternal Life, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. 2. And there the Father did, as it were, give in to the Son, the Number, Liſt or Roll of all the perſons that were to be redeemed, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17. 6. So that when Chriſt came into the World, he knew for whom he was to die, and for whom he was to make interceſſion; that it was not for all the World, but for them whom the Father had given him: and he knew who they were, as he ſaith, <hi>Joh.</hi> 10. when he ſpeaks that he was to lay down his Life for the <hi>Sheep, ver.</hi> 15. <hi>I know my ſheep, ver.</hi> 14. he muſt needs know them, for he ſtood charged with every one of them, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6. 39. So that Chriſt was a long time ſeparated to this Work before he went about it, even by the everlaſting Decree and Purpoſe of his Father, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 9, 10. Oh! what an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Mercy this Mercy by Chriſt is! It hath been laid up for the Saints of old, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the World began. 'Tis from everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and as 'tis from everlaſting, ſo 'tis to everlaſting, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103. 17.</p>
               <pb n="157" facs="tcp:64298:89"/>
               <p n="2">2. The Father did <hi>fit</hi> his Son, and fit him with all that was needful to go about ſuch a Work. As God never ſends or calls any to an Imployment, but he furniſhes them with what is neceſſary for the diſcharging of it: So he did this in a ſingular and eminent manner to Chriſt: the work that he had to do, would require a deal to be laid out upon it; he had need bring enough with him, and ſo he did: See <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 19. <hi>It pleaſed the Father, that in him ſhould all fulneſs dwell.</hi> And in <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 34. you read, that the Father gave him the Spirit <hi>without meaſure:</hi> he dealt otherwiſe with him, than he doth with the reſt of his Children. 'Tis true, be beſtows his Spirit, and the Gifts and Graces of it upon them, but to them he <hi>meaſures</hi> it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 3. He doth <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide and diſtribute to them,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 11. and he gives it ſo to them, that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſay one to another, <hi>I have no need of thee.</hi> But in his giving to Chriſt, he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved no <hi>number,</hi> no <hi>weight,</hi> no <hi>meaſure;</hi> he gave him all, all Power, all Riches, all Righteouſneſs: he dealt with us by retail, as I may ſo ſay, but he dealt with Chriſt by whole-ſale; he makes us to be as the Streams, or ſmall Rivers; but he made him the Sea; he hid all the treaſures of Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:64298:90"/> and Knowledge in him. See that one place more how Chriſt was fitted, <hi>Iſ.</hi> 11. 2. <hi>The ſpirit of the Lord ſhall reſt upon him, the ſpirit of wiſdom and underſtanding, the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of counſel and might, the ſpirit of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and of the fear of the Lord.</hi> He made him able to <hi>ſpeak ſo as never man ſpake;</hi> he made him able to comfort a wounded Spirit, ſo as never man comforted, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 50. 4. he made him able to ſuffer ſo, as never man ſuffered; he made him able to live ſo, as never man lived.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Father did <hi>aſſiſt</hi> and ſtand by him, in the doing of all that he did in the Work of our Redemption: he did not ſet him to work, and then forſake him; but his Preſence and Power went along with him. 'Tis true, he cried out upon the Croſs, <hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken me?</hi> and at that time he had an eclipſe and withdrawment of the Preſence of his Father: but this was not a total and a fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal deſertion; for even then, he could look upon God as his God, and act his Faith in him; which ſhews, that even then, he was ſupported and inabled to go through with his moſt bitter Sufferings. Now, for the Aſſiſtance that he had from his Father, you have divers places, as <hi>Iſ.</hi> 42. 1.
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:64298:90"/> 
                  <hi>Behold my ſervant whom I uphold:</hi> that is, I will go along with him in his work, with my <hi>upholding-power.</hi> God the Father lookt after him, to carry him through what he ſent him about; and ſee what he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes for him, in <hi>ver.</hi> 4. <hi>He ſhall not fail,</hi> &amp;c. As if he had ſaid, Tho 'tis a very hard Work that he hath to do, yet I'll keep him from fainting in it; and ſo he promiſes, in <hi>ver.</hi> 6. that he would <hi>hold his hand</hi> for him, as it were, to keep it from being weak or ſhaking. And in the confidence and full aſſurance of this, that he ſhould have his Fathers help, you ſhall ſee how reſolvedly and couragiouſly he goes to the Work, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 58. 5, to 10.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The Father did accept this redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-work at the hands of his Son, as that in which he was ſatisfied; as who ſhould ſay, I have enough, I demand no more: he took great content in what he had don, and ſo he doth ſtill. There be two ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent places for this; one in <hi>Joh.</hi> 10. 17. <hi>Therefore doth my Father love me, becauſe I lay down my life,</hi> &amp;c. And another in <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 2. <hi>Chriſt hath given himſelf for us an offering and a ſacrifice to God for</hi> a ſweet ſmelling ſavour. Chriſt could not have pleaſed his Father better, than by perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:64298:91"/> this Work. Oh, what a lovely delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful thing 'tis to his Soul, to ſee what his Son hath done for poor ſinners!</p>
               <p n="5">5. He did <hi>reward</hi> him for his pains. You find Chriſt, when he had done his Work, he calls for his Reward, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17. 4, 5. And if you look into <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 21. you ſhall ſee Chriſt ſaith, he hath it; <hi>As I alſo over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came, and am ſet down with my Father on his throne.</hi> In this place, he tells <hi>John</hi> in his Revelation to him from Heaven, and he bids <hi>John</hi> to tell it from him to the Church to whom he was to write, That he was well paid for all the good and great Service that he had performed in the work of our Redemption. God the Father had of old promiſed to him, that he ſhould have a large Recompence for it, as you may read, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53. 12. <hi>Therefore will I divide him a portion with the great; he ſhall divide the ſpoil with the ſtrong, becauſe he hath poured out his ſoul unto death.</hi> And if you bring this to the New Teſtament, you ſhall ſee what this <hi>Recompence</hi> was, and how fully 'twas paid in to him, and how many ways God honoured him; how he raiſed him from the dead again, and took him into Heaven, and ſet him down at his own right Hand on the Throne of the Majeſty on
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:64298:91"/> high, and made him the Head of his Body, the Church, and placed him far above all Principalities and Powers, <hi>&amp;c. Eph.</hi> 2. 20, 21, 22. and appointed him to be the Judge of all, and he to whom all muſt bow: and all this was by way of <hi>Reward</hi> to him for what he had done and ſuffered in the great Work of bringing this Freedom to us. See <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 7, 8. there you have an account of the great Service that he did about it; and then he brings in <hi>ver.</hi> 9, 10, 11. with a <hi>wherefore, Wherefore God alſo hath highly exalted him, and given him a name that is above every name: i. e.</hi> He conſidered how greatly his Son had been humbled for our ſakes, and upon that account he promoted him to this high degree of Exaltation. Thus you ſee the <hi>Father</hi> had a hand alſo in this <hi>Freedom.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And then for the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> he doth much about it too. For, it is the Spirit that doth awaken and convince the Soul that is to be ſaved, to ſee its loſt and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done condition by nature; and ſhews it, by its own illumination, <q>Why, thou art one that art in bondage.</q> That proves this by undeniable Evidence: <q>What! live ſo as thou haſt and doſt, and not be in this ſpiritual Bondage! Oh! it cannot
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:64298:92"/> be. Why, thou haſt the manifeſt ſigns and tokens of a perſon in ſlavery: what's the meaning that thou art ſo in love with ſin, and under the power and dominion of theſe and theſe Luſts? that thou art ſo given to ſuch and ſuch wicked Ways, and ſo contrary to all that is good? That thou haſt ſuch an unclean Heart, and ſuch a diſobedient Life, ſuch a dark Mind, ſuch vile Affections, ſuch a rebellious Will? Why, doth not this ſpeak that thou art an Enemy to God, and a Child of Wrath? Would, or could any Man or Woman live ſuch a carnal, vain Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation as thine is, if they were not in an unregenerate condition?</q> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you read, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16. 9. that it is the Spirit that <hi>reproves the world of ſin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again; It is the Spirit that <hi>humbles the ſoul</hi> that is to be ſaved; that abaſes and laves it low in the ſight of its own ſin and miſery, that makes ſin grievous and odious to it, and that brings the Soul un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a ſenſe of that wrath that belongs to the workers of iniquity: So that it ſhall cry out, Oh, what have I done! <q>Oh, what have I deſerved! what a dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous caſe am I in! Here's this and that ſin forbidden by God, and yet committed
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:64298:92"/> by me, and thereupon the Law threatens thus and thus. Oh, how ſhall I eſcape! Here's this and that Duty commanded by God, and yet neglected by me, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the Law threatens thus and thus again.</q> Oh, what ſhall become of me! Hence that ſorrow and heavineſs that is in ſuch a Soul now, is called the <hi>ſpirit</hi> of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vineſs, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 61. 3. to note, that this hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vineſs comes from the Spirit: 'tis he that ſets the Soul a mourning thus.</p>
               <p>Again; It is the Spirit that diſcovers to the Soul that is to be ſaved, where its <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy</hi> is for all this; that acquaints it with the Goſpel and Salvation by Chriſt, and what things God <hi>hath freely given</hi> to his People in and by his Son, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 12. That ſhews it, <q>Tho thou art ſuch a great ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, yet there is a great Saviour; one that is a Phyſician, appointed to cure ſuch Diſeaſes as thine are; one that's a Surety, appointed to pay ſuch Debts as thine are.</q> 'Tis ſaid here, that the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit makes thoſe who ſhall be ſaved, to <hi>know</hi> ſuch things as theſe are; what God hath done for the raiſing and recovering of poor ſinners, in a way of free Grace; what a glorious Contrivance he hath found out by Jeſus Chriſt, revealed in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel,
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:64298:93"/> to ſhew mercy to them: and indeed, that's a <hi>knowing</hi> that is worth the having, to <hi>know</hi> theſe things ſo, as the Spirit makes them known to the People of God. There be many that have a kind of Knowledge of theſe things by bare reading of them, and hearing of them, and by common Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of the Spirit; but this <hi>knowing</hi> here, is another manner of thing.</p>
               <p>Again; It is the Spirit that doth <hi>help and inable the Soul to look out</hi> for this Chriſt, to uſe all the means, and to go all the ways that may be, to come to this Chriſt, and to get an intereſt in him; that works in it <hi>faith</hi> to lay hold upon him, and that makes the Soul able to take him, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3. 16, 17. <hi>That he would grant you according to the riches of his glory, to be ſtrengthned with might by his ſpirit in the inner man, that Chriſt may dwell in your hearts by faith.</hi> Mark, 'tis the Spirit that by his might doth ſtrengthen the inner man, that <hi>Chriſt may dwell in the heart by faith.</hi> Take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice by the way, what a deal of Power there muſt go out from this Spirit, to make a Soul believe with the true ſaving Faith. They that have the falſe Faith, they can believe with eaſe; there needs not an Almighty Arm to be ſtretched out to work
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:64298:93"/> their Faith, they give it themſelves, and have had it all their days; they find no difficulty either in the getting of it, or in the keeping of it. But the true Faith comes into the hearts of Saints by no leſs a ſtrength than that which God by his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit puts forth: See <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 19, 20.</p>
               <p>Again; It is the Spirit that <hi>ſeals</hi> and witneſſes to the Soul, the Aſſurance that this Freedom doth belong to it, and that proves to the Soul that it is ſo, by ſuch Evidences as it gives out of the Word, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 13. This is he that carries, as I may ſay, God's <hi>Privy Seal,</hi> and when, and to whom he pleaſes he gives it; but he gives it to none but them that are ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied: <hi>The ſecret of the Lord is with them that fear him, and he will ſhow them his cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</hi> And this is an unſpeakable mercy, to have the Spirits Seal ſet to our Graces; to have ones <hi>repentance ſealed</hi> for a true Repentance, and ones <hi>faith ſealed</hi> for a true Faith, and ones <hi>comfort ſealed</hi> for true Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, and ones <hi>intereſt in Chriſt ſealed up:</hi> We muſt make our ſtate of Grace ſure <hi>by Signs,</hi> but the Spirit can make it ſure <hi>by Seal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again; It is the Spirit that <hi>ingages and ſtirs up</hi> the Soul to ſuch a walking as is ſit
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:64298:94"/> for one that is brought into a ſtate of Freedom: therefore, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 2. the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God are ſaid to have the ſanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>the Spirit</hi> unto obedience. And Oh! how much are they beholding unto this Spirit, for many heavenly Notions that he gives in to them; and for freſh quicknings, when they find abundance of deadneſs, and formality in their Duties hath ſeiſed upon them. This Spirit is often calling upon the Saints to pray more fervently, to hear more profitably, to walk more cloſely, to bring forth more fruit to God, who hath done ſo much for them. It often minds them of their Mercies, that they may be more ſtirred up to Duties; and of the hope of their Calling, that ſo they may walk more wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of it.</p>
               <p>Again; It is the Spirit that <hi>preſerves</hi> and keeps them in the ſtate of Freedom, that they ſhall not loſe it again; and that makes them to perſevere to the end in a holy life, that ſo they may come at laſt to the full injoyment of all that their dear Redeemer hath purchaſed and prepared for them. This Spirit is that Power of God, by which they are ſaid through Faith to be kept unto Salvation; See <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36. 27.
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:64298:94"/> Thus you ſee, that both the Father and the Holy Ghoſt have a hand in this Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>
               <p>But yet (according to the ſecond thing that was ſaid, in anſwer to the Queſtion) our Freedom in other reſpects comes from Chriſt <hi>perſonally</hi> and peculiarly; ſo as that in ſome ſenſe, he is and muſt be look'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as more immediatly our Redeemer; for he did that in his Perſon, which the other Perſons did not. They did not take our nature, and come in the likeneſs of ſinful fleſh, but the Son did, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 3. and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, 'twas not they, but he that was made under the Law, and that yielded perfect obedience to it: neither did they, but he <hi>died</hi> that accurſed death upon the Croſs <hi>for our ſins;</hi> and 'twas he, and not they, that <hi>roſe again the third day,</hi> and that afterwards <hi>aſcended</hi> into Heaven; and 'tis he, and not they, that is the <hi>Mediator betwixt God and man,</hi> 1 Tim. 2. 5. and divers ſuch things muſt be appropriated to the Perſon of Chriſt. 'Twas he that was put into the Offices of a <hi>Prophet, Prieſt</hi> and <hi>King;</hi> and theſe things are everywhere in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture kept ſo diſtinct from the other Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, as that Chriſt is the Doer and Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutor of them. So that our Freedom comes
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:64298:95"/> by him (as I have already ſhewed upon this Fourth Branch of the Doctrine) in a more eminent way, than by the Father or the Holy Ghoſt; tho they have all of them, as I have ſaid, in ſome reſpects, a very great hand in it. And from that, I would now deſire you to take three Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
               <p>All the three Perſons are concerned in the Freedom that comes by Chriſt: why, then conſider,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That there was not a word ſpoken in Heaven againſt the recovering of poor Sinners out of their loſt condition; not a word againſt ſhewing Mercy to them. You know; there be many great things upon Earth that come to a <hi>Propoſition,</hi> but then they meet with an <hi>Oppoſition,</hi> and ſuch an Oppoſition, that the thing propounded is daſh'd all to pieces. But it was not ſo in Heaven: there every one was for it; the Father was for it, the Son was for it, and the Holy Ghoſt was for it; and yet every one might have been againſt it. And Oh, how much might have been ſaid to have ſpoiled all; there was enough might have been alledged, to have turned all their hearts againſt us: but every one was willing that the buſineſs of our Redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:64298:95"/> ſhould go forward, all went on our ſide. You may therefore be fully aſſured, that tho there was none but the ſecond Perſon that did viſibly appear in the Work of our Redemption, yet that they are all well-wiſhers to it. Here's no place left for doubting, whether their hearts be as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinable towards your Salvation, as Chriſt did expreſs, by word of mouth, that his heart was in the days of his Fleſh: for, they do all, by mutual conſent, unite together in this Deſign of doing your Souls good, and the voice of one, is the voice of all. And when Chriſt did invite and call poor Sinners to come unto him, and declared ſo much readineſs to receive and imbrace all that were weary and heavy laden; you muſt know, that he did not only do this to ſhow his own kindneſs and good-will to the Children of Men, but alſo to ſhew what kindneſs and good will the other Perſons had in their hearts towards them too. And if you look into 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 7. you ſhall find them all joined together in this matter of Salvation by Chriſt, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with <hi>ver.</hi> 11. What an ingagement then is it to us to accept of this Salvation, when we have, as I may ſay, three ſuch <hi>great Suitors</hi> ſeeking to us; the <hi>Father</hi>
                  <pb n="170" facs="tcp:64298:96"/> ſending his <hi>Son,</hi> and the <hi>Son</hi> coming from the <hi>Father,</hi> and now Chriſt by his <hi>Spirit</hi> knocking at the door of our Hearts for an entrance. Oh, that as they are all wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling that we ſhould be ſaved, we were all willing to cloſe with this Salvation!</p>
               <p n="2">2. Since they all have a hand in it, then in our labouring to get the benefit of Chriſt's Redemption, we muſt look to all the three Perſons: 'tis not only Chriſt in particular that we muſt have an eye to, but alſo to the <hi>Father</hi> and to the <hi>Holy Ghoſt.</hi> And we muſt look to them all two ways; 1. In the way of <hi>Prayer.</hi> 2. In the way of <hi>Thanksgiving.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for <hi>Prayer;</hi> why, we muſt pray to the <hi>Father,</hi> that he would draw us to his Son; as Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6. 44. <hi>No man can come to me, except the Father which hath ſent me draw him.</hi> We muſt pray to the <hi>Son,</hi> that he would have mercy upon us, and heal us, and that he would help our Unbelief; as you read they did in the Goſpel, when he was here in his bodily Preſence. We muſt pray to the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> to inlighten our Minds in the ſaving un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of Chriſt and the Goſpel, to ſanctifie us and make us obedient to the word of Grace, and effectually to apply
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:64298:96"/> to us the Redemption that comes by Chriſt, and all the benefits of it. But here we muſt take heed, that when we do thus ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs our ſelves (as ſometimes we may) in ſuch kind of Petitions as are directed more particularly to one Perſon, we don't think that the other Perſons are at that time ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded.</p>
               <p>And then we muſt look to all the three Perſons, in a way of <hi>Thanksgiving:</hi> For if every one hath a hand in our Redemption, then we are beholding to every one of them; and ſo we may not only make an Acknowledgment of it to the whole <hi>God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head</hi> jointly, but alſo to <hi>each</hi> of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons particularly; and ſo you ſhall ſee, the People of God have ſometimes done. As for Thankſgiving to the <hi>Father,</hi> ſee <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 3. and for Thankſgiving to the <hi>Son, Rev.</hi> 1. 5, 6. And tho we have not, as I remember, any Scripture, in which the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> is given thanks to in this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular way of naming of him; yet, you muſt know, that in thoſe places in which Praiſe is rendred unto God, he is there to be underſtood. Well then, as I ſaid, we ſhould be admiring and praiſing every one of them for this Work, and ſaying, Oh, bleſſed be the <hi>Father,</hi> that ſent his only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:64298:97"/> Son out of his Boſom, to be a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour to Mankind! And Oh, bleſſed be Jeſus Chriſt, the Son of God, who laid down his Life to be a Ranſom for us! And Oh, bleſſed be the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> which hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to any of our Souls the application, comfort, and ſealing up of this Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on! Bleſſed be that <hi>one God</hi> in <hi>three Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons</hi> for ever and ever. Amen.</p>
               <p n="3">3. If there be ſuch a <hi>Three</hi> that join together to further the Saints Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; then <hi>another Three</hi> that join toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to hinder their Salvation, ſhall not be able to do it. There is a <hi>Three</hi> that would fain keep every Child of God out of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; the <hi>World,</hi> the <hi>Fleſh</hi> and the <hi>Devil:</hi> and 'tis true, they are three great and mighty Enemies; howbeit, they attain not to the <hi>firſt Three,</hi> 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 11. 21. Oh! you that fear God, when you think what <hi>Three</hi> there are againſt you, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon are ready to be diſheartned; why, think what <hi>Three</hi> there are for you, and then be comforted. What are the <hi>Three below</hi> to the <hi>Three above?</hi> The Saints do too little mind what great Friends and Helps are ingaged on their ſide. It daunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> to ſee that great <hi>Goliath</hi> coming againſt them, becauſe
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:64298:97"/> they looked no higher than themſelves: but little <hi>David</hi> went forth with Courage and Reſolution to meet him, becauſe he knew that he had God on his ſide, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 17. 45. <hi>Thou comeſt to me with a ſword, and with a ſpear, and with a ſhield; but I come to thee in the name of the Lord of hoſts;</hi> and ſo he prevailed. This is the Cordial that true Chriſtians muſt take along with them, in their journey to Heaven, to keep them from fainting, That Father, Son and Spirit are all ingaged in the matters of their Salvation. And 'tis certain, that they would not be ſo fearful and ſo weak in their work as they are apt to be, if they did but know their ſtrength. And ſo this is the firſt thing that ſhews, After what manner this Freedom is in Chriſt: 'Tis in him <hi>Perſonally.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. This Freedom is in Chriſt <hi>abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly:</hi> So <hi>Paul</hi> found it, when the Lord had mercy on him, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 14. You know, the manner of men is, when they give others of their good things, to give but a little of them: it may be, rhey have not ſuch a ſtore of their own, as to be able to part with much. But 'tis not ſo with Chriſt; this Freedom is ſtor'd up in him, he hath Treaſures of it: 'tis much that
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:64298:98"/> Chriſt can do for Souls; that place is very full for it, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 25. <hi>He is able alſo to ſave them to the uttermoſt that come unto God by him.</hi> The word in the Greek is, as if you ſhould read it, He is able to ſave to the <hi>finiſhing or perfecting of all,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. Whatever is in Chriſt, 'tis in him abundantly. Conſider four things, and you'll ſee 'tis thus with him in reſpect of this Freedom: 'tis in him <hi>plentifully.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>1. He can ſave more than ever ſhall be ſaved. The reaſon why ſuch multitudes do poſt and flock to Hell, is not becauſe there was not enough in Chriſt to keep them from it, but becauſe they will not be <hi>ruled</hi> by him; they do not follow this Phyſicians Preſcriptions. Here upon Earth, though the Patient makes the beſt uſe that can be of the Phyſician, and follows his Preſcriptions and Advice to a tittle, and doth all things to the exacteſt obedience; yet many times the Patient dies notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, or he is never the more deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the pain and danger of his Diſeaſe; as it was with the Woman that had the bloody Iſſue, <hi>Mark</hi> 5. 25, 26. And the Diſeaſe is ſo inveterate and malignant, that all the skill of the Doctors is not able to cure them or preſerve them. But here, no
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:64298:98"/> Soul is loſt for want of Skill or Power in the Phyſician; but 'tis becauſe they would not do as he would have them; they would not ſubmit to his Cure, nor accept of his Help: they ſhould have found <hi>him</hi> a Healer, if he had found <hi>them</hi> obedient, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 81. 11, 12.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> But you may ſay, If Chriſt hath ſuch a Power, he could have made them obedient if he pleaſed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> That's true, he could have done ſo, and ſo he doth to ſome; he doth make them obedient and willing, that he will not only give <hi>Advice,</hi> but they ſhall take <hi>Advice,</hi> and give up themſelves to be wholly at Chriſt's direction and counſel; and where-ever this is wrought in the Soul, it is the free Grace and diſtinguiſhing Love of God. The overcoming of the Will to cloſe with Chriſt, is indeed the breaking forth of God's eternal Election, and he will do this in all whom he hath choſen: but when God ſees, that tho men cannot of themſelves receive Chriſt, yet they do wickedly and wilfully reſiſt the offers of his Grace, and through the pride of their Hearts, will not cry to him to make them willing, and to bring down the ſtubborn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and rebellion of their ſpirits; who will
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:64298:99"/> dare to blame <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap> if he leave them to themſelves? <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap> ſure, as 'tis unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Mercy in God to draw ſome to wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingneſs; So 'tis a very righteous thing in him to leave others to their wilfulneſs. God is not bound to ſave any man againſt his will; and whom he pleaſes he may make willing, and whom he pleaſes he may let alone in their rebellion: and ſo they don't periſh becauſe Chriſt could not ſave them, but becauſe they would not be ſaved; and they manifeſted that they would not, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they <hi>always reſiſted the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> Acts 7. 51.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> But how doth this conſiſt with that great willingneſs that is in Chriſt to ſave Sinners (of which we are ſo often told) that ſo many Sinners ſhould periſh, and yet Chriſt could ſave them?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. The willingneſs that is in Chriſt to ſave Sinners, muſt eſpecially and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally, as I conceive, be underſtood of thoſe kind of Sinners, who ſeek to him out of a ſenſe of their need of his Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and of their undone condition with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out him; as appears from <hi>Matth.</hi> 11. 28. <hi>Come unto me all ye that labour and are hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy laden, and I will give you reſt.</hi> As the Lord Jeſus, in the days of his Fleſh, did
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:64298:99"/> upon all occaſions of the coming of the diſeaſed perſons to him, manifeſt his great readineſs to cure them, and he turned away none that offered themſelves to him; by them he would be prevailed with, and by them he would be touched; and as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny as touched him, were made perfectly whole of whatever Diſeaſe they had: So, whoever they be, whatever ſpiritual Plagues they have, that do humbly and ſenſibly offer themſelves to Chriſt as the Phyſician of their Souls, and cry to him; Lord Jeſus, be intreated to cure me of a blind Mind, of a hard Heart, of the ſtrong Poſſeſſion that the Devil hath taken hold of me by ſuch a ſin, and ſuch a ſin; 'tis certain, that Jeſus Chriſt doth, as I may ſay, ſtand prepared to help ſuch a Soul, and to have mercy upon him, and heal him. And therefore you muſt know, that Jeſus Chriſt requires this at your hands, that you who would have Mercy and Salvation from him, ſhould repair to him, and come and ſpread, as it were, your Wounds be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, and implore his help. You muſt not ſtay away from Chriſt, and keep at a diſtance from him, but go and tell him the miſery that your Souls are in, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech him to ſhew his skill upon you; and
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:64298:100"/> this will be the way to get him to be mov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with compaſſion towards you: Then you'll find, that he hath a willingneſs in his heart to do you good; and the more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunate you are with him, the more hopes you will have to ſpeed with him; yea, you need not doubt or fear, if you do ſincerely make out to him for his help, but you ſhall have it; you are to believe that you ſhall: And if you do not thus look out for help in Chriſt, but neglect coming to him that is appointed of God to ſave you; as you will certainly periſh, ſo, tho you ſhall, yet your deſtruction doth not proceed from a want of willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in Chriſt to ſave you: tho I confeſs, this willingneſs that is in Chriſt to ſave even them that ſhall never be ſaved, is not the ſame with that which is in him to ſave thoſe who are to be ſaved. You muſt take notice, that this willingneſs of Chriſt to ſave ſinners, may be conſidered two ways.</p>
               <p n="1">1. There is an <hi>abſolute</hi> willingneſs in Chriſt to ſave ſome ſinners, and theſe ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners are thoſe whom God hath, from all eternity, choſen to life; and who there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon do come to Chriſt, that they might have life, being awakened and ſtirred up
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:64298:100"/> thereunto by the inward and effectual working of Gods Spirit and Grace upon their hearts. Now there is in Chriſt an <hi>abſolute</hi> willingneſs to ſave all ſuch; he is fully reſolved to be <hi>wiſdom, and righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and ſanctification, and redemption to them,</hi> Joh. 6. 37.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There is a <hi>conditional</hi> willingneſs in Chriſt to ſave other ſinners, yea all ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, yea even thoſe that ſhall never be ſaved; by which Chriſt ſtands ready to receive, and pardon, and imbrace them, in caſe they come to him, and repent and believe the Goſpel: which they never doing, through the hardneſs and impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency of their hearts, to which they are juſtly left, they are eternally loſt, tho Chriſt could have ſaved them, and would have ſaved them, if the Condition had been performed, <hi>Luk.</hi> 13. 34.</p>
               <p>Secondly, it will appear that this Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom is in Chriſt abundantly, if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider how he and his Salvation are magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied and extolled in Scripture. You ſhall find the Word of GOD ſpeaking very honourably of both, as indeed he and his Salvation deſerve the higheſt Praiſe. When Chriſt himſelf, as a Redeemer, is ſpoken of, ſee the great commendation that is
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:64298:101"/> given of him; I ſhall need to lead you but to that one Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> for it; See <hi>chap.</hi> 4. 15. and <hi>chap.</hi> 7. 26. and <hi>chap.</hi> 8. 1, 2, 6. and <hi>chap.</hi> 9. 14. And then, as he himſelf who is the Saviour, is thus ſet forth with ſuch magnificent Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions; So the Salvation and Redemption that comes by him likewiſe, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 3. <hi>How ſhall we eſcape, if we neglect ſo great ſalvation?</hi> He ſpeaks of it, as that which cannot be told what manner of thing 'tis, for the Worth and Value of it; he is ſo taken up with the admiration of it, that he wants a fit compariſon to ſet it out by. <hi>So great ſalvation;</hi> as if he ſhould have ſaid, I cannot tell you how great 'tis, 'tis ſo great. And in 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 18, 19. <hi>Ye were not redeemed with corruptible things, as ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver and gold,—but with the precious blood of Chriſt, as of a lamb without blemiſh and without ſpot.</hi> He makes all the Silver and Gold, and precious things of the World as nothing, to this Redemption which the Blood of Chriſt hath purchaſed for us.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, there muſt needs be abundant Freedom in Chriſt, if we conſider, that this Redemption of his doth more good to them that partake of it, than ever the Fall of <hi>Adam</hi> did them hurt. It was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:64298:101"/> an unſpeakable deal of miſery that was brought in by the Tranſgreſſion of our firſt Parents; by it came Sin, by it came Death and Condemnation. Beloved, there is no evil either of Sin or of Puniſhment, either in this World or in that to come, but it is the woful effect and fruit of that Fall. Oh, that God would ſhew us what a miſerable condition we are in by the Fall! Oh, how ignorant is the World of this! How unawakened about it! Little do the moſt conſider, where it is that <hi>Adam</hi> hath left them; what wretched, curſed Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures they are upon that account; and Oh, how little care do People generally take, or how little haſte do they make to get out of it! How ſecure do the moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue upon that ſinking ground, as if there were no danger towards them! Well, but now this Redemption by Chriſt hath more good in it, for them that are or ſhall be delivered by it, than that had hurt in it. This ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> ſets them into a better condition, than ever they were before they fell: He doth not only make up their loſs again, but with the greateſt advantage. Read that excellent place, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 15. to the end.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, 'Tis ſuch abundant Redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>that
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:64298:102"/> is in Chriſt, that he can ſave thoſe that deſpair of ever being ſaved; not only can he ſave thoſe who deſerve to be damned, but even ſuch as deſpair of being ſaved. Oh, how many be there, that have lain under moſt dreadful fears of everlaſting condemnation! that when they have been brought to ſee their ſins, as it were, ſet in order before them, and to ſee the wrath of God, as it were, flaming againſt them; they have concluded, that they ſhould as certainly go to Hell, as if they were there already: And, Oh, the bitter cryes that they have had upon this! Oh, the anguiſh and ſorrow that their Souls have been filled with, <hi>What ſhall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of me?</hi> &amp;c. They have roared by reaſon of the diſquietneſs of their hearts; they could not tell how to eat, or drink, or ſleep, for the fearful looking-for of Judgment and of Wrath that ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour them; and yet, after all this, have been ſaved: the great Redeemer hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven them reſt from their fear, and from their ſorrow, and from the hard bondage wherein they were made to ſerve, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 15. And it may be, here may be ſome or other amongſt you that are full of trembling thoughts, and very ready to ſpeak about
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:64298:102"/> your Salvation, as if there were no hope. I know that many poor Souls do go under this load; they can't tell how to think that they ſhall ever be ſaved. Oh, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, there is ſuch abundance of Freedom in Chriſt, that he can ſave thoſe who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair of being ſaved: and therefore be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived in thy hopes, thou poor diſheart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Soul; and becauſe of this, ſay as <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nah</hi> did, <hi>chap.</hi> 2. 3, 4. <hi>For thou hadſt caſt me into the deep, in the midſt of the ſeas, and the floods compaſſed me about: all thy billows and thy waves paſſed over me. Then I ſaid, I am caſt out of thy ſight; yet I will look again toward thy holy temple.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. This Freedom is in Chriſt <hi>freely;</hi> the very word doth carry this along with it. Chriſt doth not releaſe Souls, as men uſe to give Freedom to the Bodies of them they have kept in priſon; if they will have their Liberty, they muſt pay their Fees. That which God ſpeaks of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 45. 13. is eminently true of Chriſt, <hi>He ſhall let go my captives, not for price or reward.</hi> Chriſt doth not ask Souls, <hi>What will you give me,</hi> if I will do this for you? But he is willing to do it <hi>for nothing;</hi> he bids them <hi>come and buy,</hi> but 'tis <hi>without</hi>
                  <pb n="184" facs="tcp:64298:103"/> 
                  <hi>money and without price;</hi> he is as glad to free poor ſinners, as they are to be freed by him. And there be three Reaſons, why Chriſt doth all freely in the Work of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption: pray mark them.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe <hi>he redeems them out of love;</hi> therefore he aims at no reward. What is it that brings Chriſt to this Work? why 'tis Love, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 63. 9.—<hi>in his love, and in his pity he redeemed them.</hi> Tit. 4. 5. <hi>Rev.</hi> 1. 5. Now, <hi>Love doth not work for wages.</hi> Beloved, you muſt know, that when the Lord Jeſus was upon this redeeming-Work, his heart was as full of love towards poor ſinners, as it could hold: you may ſay of Chriſt in this reſpect, as they ſaid of him once when he was weeping at <hi>Lazarus</hi> his Grave, <hi>Behold how he loved him,</hi> Joh. 11. 35, 36. So when he was in his bloody Agony and Sweat, and hung pierced upon the Croſs, and was ſuffering all that wrath from God and Men; this might have been in the thoughts of them that beheld him, and no doubt was in the thoughts of them that believed in him, <hi>Behold how he loves poor ſinners.</hi> Now you know, when a man comes to do any thing for you out of love, why if you ask him, What will you have? Why, nothing, ſaith he, becauſe <hi>I</hi>
                  <pb n="185" facs="tcp:64298:103"/> 
                  <hi>love you.</hi> Set one about any thing that you have to do, and if he doth not love you, why he will be paid to the full, and perhaps he will make unreaſonable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands too: But <hi>Love</hi> will labour for you for nothing; 'twill be glad of an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to do you a kindneſs. Thus 'twas with Chriſt; he went through hard things for you; you cannot think what he ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that you might be ſaved: and yet, as <hi>Jacob</hi>'s ſerving ſo many years for <hi>Rachel ſeemed to him but few days, for the love he had to her;</hi> So, tho Chriſt ſuffered many things for you that are his, yet to him they ſeem leſs than they are, for the <hi>Love</hi> he hath to you.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Becauſe <hi>Chriſt knew that he wrought for the poor,</hi> Pſal. 72. 2, 4, 12, 13. Now the poor, why they muſt be helped freely. Alas! we have nothing to give him for his labour; and Chriſt knew this, and yet he did not do as many do; when the poor have need of their help, they are ready to ſay, <hi>I'll not work for them, they can't pay me.</hi> Men love to work moſt for the Rich, where they ſhall be ſure of their Money: But the Lord Jeſus, he doth the <hi>poor mans work;</hi> and ſo, tho they have a great deal of profit by it, yet he hath none to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
               <pb n="186" facs="tcp:64298:104"/>
               <p n="3">3. Becauſe the <hi>great deſign of this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeming Work which is in the hands of Chriſt, is the everlaſting exalting of Free Grace,</hi> that Glory might be aſcribed unto God throughout all Ages, World without end: See <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 6, 7. Therefore, all muſt come freely, that <hi>Free Grace</hi> might be advanced, that every one that is ſaved, might admire the riches of the Goodneſs and Love of GOD in Chriſt to their Souls. Oh, what Praiſes hath the Lord from his People, and will have to all Eternity, for this Free Grace! Oh, admire it more, you that are under it! It muſt be your work in Heaven, and we may be glad that it ſhall be our work in Heaven, when we conſider how ſhort we come in the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miring of it here upon Earth.</p>
               <p n="4">4. This Freedom is in Chriſt <hi>only.</hi> As to the Body, there may be many Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians for one Diſeaſe; but as to the Soul, there is but one Phyſician for all Diſeaſes, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 45. latter part of <hi>ver.</hi> 21. and the 22.—<hi>A Saviour there is none beſide me. Look unto me and be ye ſaved, all ye ends of the earth: for I am God, and there is none elſe.</hi> We have many ſpiritual Sickneſſes, but 'tis Chriſt alone that can heal us; whoever

                  </gap> his hand, he dies for it; and therefore, don't truſt to Phyſicians of no value. Many are apt to do for their Souls, as you read <hi>Ahaziah</hi> did, when he had gotten a very dangerous Fall; he ſent to the Idol gods, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 1. 2. <hi>Go, and inquire of Baalzebub the god of Ekron, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I ſhall recover of this diſeaſe.</hi> And what he got by this, you ſhall ſee, by what the Lord bids the Prophet go and tell him, <hi>ver.</hi> 3, 4. <hi>Is it not becauſe there is not a God in Iſrael, that ye go to inquire of Baalzebub the god of Ekron? Now therefore, thus ſaith the Lord, Thou ſhalt not come down from that bed on which thou art gone up, but ſhalt ſurely die.</hi> Let me allude a little to this Scripture. Sinner, thou art juſt in the caſe of this man: thou haſt gotten a moſt dangerous Fall; thou art fallen from <hi>the upper Chamber;</hi> when God created thee at firſt, by that Image of his in which he made thee, he put thee into <hi>the upper Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.</hi> Oh, the high Preferment that thou waſt in, 'twas a heavenly condition that thou hadſt, to be without ſin, and to be like to God: but thou art fallen from hence, and thy Fall hath done thee a world of hurt: now when thou beginneſt to be ſick of thy Fall, and thereupon to think,
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:64298:105"/> that ſome courſe muſt be taken for the getting of a Cure; Oh, take heed to whom thou goeſt: for if thou goeſt to any but <hi>the God in Iſrael,</hi> I mean to Jeſus Chriſt, who is <hi>the hope of Iſrael, and the Saviour thereof in the time of trouble,</hi> I tell thee from the Lord, <hi>thou ſhalt ſurely die.</hi> The great fear, when Souls begin to be awakened about their condition, is, Whether they will go to Chriſt <hi>only;</hi> and if they join any thing with him to truſt to, and reſt in, they ſpoil all; you muſt come up to that Scripture, or you are undone, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 3. <hi>For we are the circumciſion, which worſhip God in the ſpirit; and rejoice in Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, and have no confidence in the fleſh.</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member what a warning Chriſt gave in another caſe, I may fitly allude to it, <hi>Matth.</hi> 24. 4, 5. <hi>Many ſhall come in my name, ſaying, I am Chriſt, and ſhall deceive many.</hi> This is ordinary amongſt Profeſſors to be thus deceived; there comes this and that <hi>Profeſſion, Duties, common Workings</hi> upon the Soul, and the like, and theſe are apt to ſay, Why, <hi>I am Chriſt:</hi> Now, 'tis thus and thus with thee; thou wilt do well: and many believe this, and are deceived. And therefore, when you begin to look after a Chriſt, be ſure to look after the
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:64298:105"/> 
                  <hi>true One;</hi> for 'tis <hi>he,</hi> and none but he, that can do the Work: and don't think, that becauſe there be ſo many falſe chriſts, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore 'tis impoſſible to know the true One; read for that, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 20.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> But how ſhall I know, that it is the true Chriſt that I truſt to? <hi>Anſ.</hi> I'll only ſay this to it; <hi>The true Chriſt makes a true Chriſtian:</hi> they are not only Chriſtians to men, but Chriſtians to God. Now thou art thus and thus to men, but what art thou to God? Is thy heart ſavingly wrought upon? Haſt thou the Life and Spirit of Jeſus Chriſt within thee? It may be thou art, for thy outward appearance, as the King's Daughter, thy <hi>clothing is of wrought gold;</hi> but art thou <hi>all glorious within? Pſal.</hi> 45. 13.</p>
               <p n="5">5. This Freedom is in Chriſt <hi>continually.</hi> We may apply that place to him, even for this, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 10. He hath delivered many already from ſo great a death as the death of the Soul, and now alſo he is <hi>delivering more:</hi> he is upon this Work, of giving Freedom to poor ſinners, and we are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident that <hi>he will yet deliver;</hi> Chriſt won't loſe the power of doing Souls good; fear not, he won't be put out of his Office.
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:64298:106"/> There be three things, through which men continue not in their Office, but neither of them will happen to Chriſt; 1. <hi>

But Chriſt is ſuch an able Redeemer, that he will never be put out for unfitneſs; tho the buſineſs of Souls be very weighty, yet he wants no Ability, <hi>All power is given him in heaven and in earth,</hi> Matth. 28. 18. 2. <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nfaithfulneſs,</hi> that they are not true to their Truſt; but it is not ſo with Chriſt, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3. 2. He was <hi>faithful to him that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed him.</hi> So in <hi>chap.</hi> 2. 17. he is ſaid to be a <hi>merciful and faithful high Prieſt,</hi> &amp;c. 3. <hi>Death:</hi> You know when a man in Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice dies, then another muſt take his place; but as for Chriſt, ſee <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 23, 24, 25. <hi>He continueth ever,</hi> and <hi>he ever liveth,</hi> &amp;c. When God the Father put him into this Office, he ſaid to him, <hi>Thou art a prieſt for ever, after the order of Melchiſedec.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now, to end this Fourth Branch with a little Application.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 1. Doth our Freedom come by Chriſt? Then this ſhews us what an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done condition we are all in by nature:
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:64298:106"/> no man can deliver himſelf out of the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery which he is in by ſin; we cannot get out of that Priſon in which we are <hi>bound;</hi> we cannot knock off our own Chains; till Chriſt comes and ſets us free, we remain in our <hi>houſe of bondage;</hi> we are <hi>blind,</hi> and cannot ſee till he opens our eys; we are <hi>dead,</hi> and cannot live till he quicken us; we are <hi>loſt,</hi> and cannot be found till he comes to ſeek and to ſave that which was loſt, I warn you from hence to take heed of that Doctrine of Pride, that tells men in the ſtate of nature, that <hi>they may be ſaved if they will;</hi> that takes the Power out of this Redeemers hands, and puts it into the hands of fallen ſinful Creatures. If ever God intends mercy to us, we ſhall know that our help is in him, and not in our ſelves; and that we muſt be born again, not of our own will, but of the will of God; and that we have no ſuch will of our own, till he doth make us willing, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 13. <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 13. The Devil is a great Enemy to the Free Grace of God; and therefore he doth what he can to exalt Free-will in man, as if he had that within him that is ſufficient to bring him to Heaven. Oh, Beloved! man hath that in his corrupt Nature, that is
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:64298:107"/> ſufficient to bring him to Hell, but no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that is ſufficient to bring him to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. Why did not the man that was wounded by the Thieves, and left half dead, bind up his own Wounds? Why was he not his own Phyſician, if he could? What need the good <hi>Samaritan</hi> come and ſhew ſo much compaſſion to him, and take ſo much care of him, if he could have help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelf? So certainly Chriſt did more than need was, if man of himſelf hath ſuch a power to reſtore himſelf: If this be true, what great hurt had we by the Fall, or what great good do we receive by Chriſt? When he came from the Boſom of his Father to undertake the great Work of our Redemption, might he not even have told the World, Why, I ſee you are not in ſuch a bad condition, but that you can help your ſelves; you can get out if you will: and ſo he might have returned back to Heaven again, and have let all alone; and then, what would have become of all the World?</p>
               <p>Labour therefore to be ſenſible of your wretchedneſs and helpleſsneſs in your ſelves, and do not think that you can do any thing without Chriſt, that is truly ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual. The way to be rich, is to ſee that
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:64298:107"/> you are poor; and the way to be ſaved, is to ſee that you are loſt. You know, that as long as one that is diſeaſed, thinks that he hath ſomething at home that will do him good, he won't ſend for the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician, but he will be tampering with his own Medicines. And 'tis certainly a ſign that a Soul is not awakned to purpoſe, nor wounded deep enough with its own ſinful condition, when it thinks it can heal it ſelf. Oh! if thou wert but ſick to the very heart, thou wouldſt ſee thou can'ſt not be thine own Phyſician. A mans De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction is of himſelf, but his Salvation is not, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 13. 9. <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 8. <hi>For by grace are ye ſaved, through faith, and that not of your ſelves: it is the gift of God.</hi>

                  <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 2. Doth <hi>Freedom come by Chriſt?</hi> Then Oh, what a Friend is Chriſt to poor ſinners! A man, you know, is counted a Friend, according to the Kindneſs that he ſhews us; and if he hath ſhewed us great kindneſs, then we count him a great Friend. Now the Kindneſs of the Lord Jeſus hath been very great towards us, in purchaſing Freedom for us; and therefore, we muſt own him as our great Friend. Chriſt once ſaid to the Diſciples, <hi>Ye are my Friends;</hi> but, Oh! what cauſe had the Diſciples to
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:64298:108"/> ſay to Chriſt, Thou art <hi>our</hi> Friend? Oh, Sirs, you that are redeemed by Chriſt, mourn for this, that you can no more look upon Chriſt as your Friend: how hard are ſome of you yet to be perſwaded of this, tho he hath done ſuch great things for you! How apt are you ſtill, by Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief, to queſtion whether Chriſt be your Friend. You would wonder, if you ſhould ſee a man that was in great diſtreſs, owing a vaſt Debt, and looking every hour when the Serjeant ſhould come and arreſt him, and hale him away to Priſon; or kept as a Slave by ſome mercileſs Enemy, and utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly unable to redeem himſelf; and ſome tender-hearted rich Perſon comes and pays all this Debt for him, and without any deſert of his, gives in his Ranſom, and ſo releaſes him out of Priſon and Captivity: Why now, to ſee this man, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all this, to be ſtill fearing and queſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, whether he that did this for him be his Friend; ſurely you would wonder at him, and be ready to ſay, You are the ſtrangeſt man that ever was! your <hi>Friend!</hi> why, do you make any doubt of that? hath he not ſufficiently ſhewn it? Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in could he have manifeſted it more, than in what he hath done for you? Have not

Let not Chriſt be for any thing, and you be againſt it; nor he be againſt any thing, and you be for it. It would be a ſad thing, if Chriſt ſhould be diſpleaſed by Enemies and Friends too: his Enemies they carry themſelves unto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly and croſsly to him; but oh, don't you that are his Friends do ſo too; this <hi>beſt Friend</hi> hath deſerved your <hi>beſt car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage</hi> towards him, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15. 13, 14. 3. If you have a great and ſpecial Friend, you won't leave him; you'll think you ſhall never have ſuch another, as indeed true Friends are very ſcarce. Thus let it be with you in reſpect of Chriſt: Oh, don't leave him; be not like thoſe Diſciples who <hi>went back and walked no more with him,</hi> Joh. 6. 66. I may apply that in <hi>Prov.</hi> 27. 10. <hi>Thy own friend, and thy fathers friend forſake not.</hi> Why Chriſt is a Friend to <hi>thee,</hi> and he was a Friend to thy <hi>father;</hi> forſake him not. If thou turneſt a back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlider from Chriſt, there will be two great Evils in it among others; 1. To be ſure

                  <hi>Vſe</hi> 3. Doth Freedom come by Chriſt? Then <hi>they, and they only who are in Chriſt, are ſafe.</hi> 'Tis the having of this Freedom (and that is by being in him) that puts Souls out of danger; and all that are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it, are in harms-way; they ſtand where the Storm will fall.

<pb n="199" facs="tcp:64298:110"/> with a Witneſs; you your ſelves, if you have it, ſhall ſay 'tis ſo, ſhall find it ſo. Beloved, there's not a Soul made free by Chriſt, but is ready, as it were, to ſet its Hand and Seal to this, That 'tis an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Freedom that the Lord Jeſus be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtows upon ſuch as believe in him; and to ſay to Chriſt upon this account, as <hi>Laban</hi> did to <hi>Jacob</hi> in another caſe, <hi>I have found by experience that the Lord hath bleſſed me for thy ſake,</hi> Gen. 30. 27. I will preſently proceed to the opening of the <hi>Excellency</hi> of it; only I would tell you two things, by way of Preface to it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. There is more in this Freedom than I am able to make known to you. I ſhall endeavour to do ſomething towards it, and the Lord help me in it: but you muſt not expect that I ſhould ſet it forth as it is. I confeſs mine own inability to handle this Subject as it deſerves: If you had ſome others to ſpeak to you about it, they would lead you further into it than I can: but whoever ſhould ſpeak to you about it, no Tongue of Man is able to unfold it in ſuch a manner as to ſay, Now I have told you all, and there is no more in this Freedom than you have heard of it. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved, this Freedom by Chriſt is one of
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:64298:111"/> the <hi>deep things of God;</hi> we cannot fathom it, 'tis ſo deep; we cannot reach it, 'tis ſo high; we cannot meaſure it, 'tis ſo broad and ſo large. If we could but ſee it as it is, it would be with us as it was with the Queen of <hi>Sheba,</hi> of whom you read, that when ſhe came and ſaw the Glory of <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> ſhe was ſo raviſhed with it, that <hi>there was no more ſpirit in her,</hi> 1 Kings 10. 4, 5. And tho ſhe confeſſed, that the report that ſhe had heard of it before was true; yet ſhe ſaw that in it when ſhe beheld it, that <hi>the half was not told her,</hi> ver. 6, 7. And therefore, if it were no more but this that I ſhould ſay about this Freedom by Chriſt, That it is ſuch a kind of thing, that all the Miniſters of the Goſpel in the World are not ſufficient to ſet it forth: Why, you might conclude even from thence, Then certainly 'tis a very <hi>excellent Freedom.</hi> For, Oh, what abundance doth the Lord help his Miniſters to declare about Chriſt and heavenly things! And yet, that not one, not any, not all of them, with all their Gifts, with all their Graces, with all their Study, with all their Prayers, are able to open this Freedom as it is; Why truly then, you may even ſay with aſtoniſhment concerning it, as they did when the Lord
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:64298:111"/> had ſo ſtrangly turned the captivity of <hi>Zion, Pſal.</hi> 126. 2. The Lord hath done <hi>great things</hi> for his people; there is ſome <hi>great,</hi> ſome <hi>excellent</hi> thing in it without doubt.</p>
               <p n="2">2. I would tell you this alſo before I go any further, That when we have done what we can through Gods aſſiſtance, to ſet out the excellency of this Freedom; and when you have heard, it may be, ſuch things about it, as may even cauſe you to ſay, Well, now we have had this Subject o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to us, we cannot but acknowledg that this Freedom by Chriſt, hath abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of worth in it: oh, what a preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous thing it is! Yet ſtill that which muſt make it excellent indeed in the eye and eſteem of <hi>your</hi> Souls, is <hi>your having an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in it.</hi> Beloved, a man may ſay of Chriſt, and of the things of Chriſt, they are <hi>precious,</hi> and yet they may not be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious to <hi>him;</hi> no doubt but many a wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed man hath ſaid, that Chriſt is <hi>precious,</hi> and yet he was not ſo to <hi>him,</hi> becauſe he did not believe in him, 1 Pet. 2. 7. <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto you therefore which believe, he is precious.</hi> Mark, he <hi>is</hi> precious to <hi>you:</hi> this is the difference between an unbeliever and a believer, the one ſays that Chriſt is preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:64298:112"/> but the other <hi>prizes</hi> him. Nothing will make this Freedom ſo precious to you, as your part in it. Our propriety in a thing puts a kind of excellency upon it in our account, tho it be but mean in it ſelf; and the want of that, makes us have but low thoughts of a thing, tho it be never ſo good; one may drop ſome words by way of commending a good thing; but if it be not ones <hi>own,</hi> one hath no prizing thoughts of it. You know if a man hath but an ordinary houſe of his <hi>own,</hi> tho he may ſay of one that is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and ten times better than his, ſuch a one hath a brave ſeat; yet his prizing thoughts run moſt out to his own; he hath an intereſt and propriety in that, but he hath not in the other. So you may in words commend this Freedom, and ſay, what an excellent thing 'tis; but if it ſhould be with you, as <hi>Peter</hi> ſaid to <hi>Simon,</hi> Acts 8. <hi>Thou haſt neither part nor lot in this matter, for thy heart is not right in the ſight of God,</hi> it will not be excellent to you. Tho Chriſt cannot be more beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful then he is, as to himſelf, yet propri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety in him will make him look, as to us, ten thouſand times more lovely then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, <hi>Cant.</hi> 5. <hi>ult.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="203" facs="tcp:64298:112"/>
               <p> Well, now to proceed to the clearing up of this, that this is an <hi>excellent, moſt excellent</hi> Freedom, I ſhall make it out by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening theſe Seven following things.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. <hi>The excellent Names by which it is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.</hi>

                  </item>
                  <item>6: <hi>The excellent <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſes that may be made of it.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>7. <hi>The many Wonders that may be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in it.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
               <p>And when I have gone through theſe things, I ſhall make Application of this Branch of the Doctrine, and ſo finiſh my whole work upon this Text.</p>
               <p>To the 1. This Freedom by Chriſt is an <hi>excellent Freedom,</hi> as we may gather from the <hi>excellent Names</hi> which are gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to it in the Scriptures. It was taken for a great honour amongſt the <hi>Romans,</hi> to have more Names than one; and when
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:64298:113"/> they would reprove one that was of a low condition, that did take more upon him, than became his place, they would tell him that he carried himſelf as if he had <hi>three names;</hi> for that was a note of excellency among them, to have three names. Now 'tis the excellency of this Freedom by Chriſt, that it hath more than three, it hath many names, and every one of them will help you to ſee what an excellent Freedom 'tis.</p>
               <p>Sometimes 'tis called <hi>deliverance,</hi> ſee Joel 2. 32. <hi>In mount Zion and Jeruſalem ſhall be Deliverance.</hi> In this place, this Freedom by Chriſt is alluded to and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecied of; and hence Chriſt himſelf is called the <hi>Deliverer, Rom.</hi> 11. 26. Now what an excellent thing is <hi>deliverance</hi> counted among us. If any body be in trouble, affliction, pain, or danger any way; oh, they would fain have <hi>delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</hi> If a woman be in travel; oh, how ſhe groans for <hi>deliverance, Rev.</hi> 12. 2. and when ſhe is <hi>delivered,</hi> oh, how glad ſhe is of it, <hi>John</hi> 16. 21. <hi>Deliverance</hi> is ſuch a thing, if one be in diſtreſs, that they who want faith will have it, if it be poſſible, tho they uſe unlawful means for it: Yea 'tis ſuch a thing that Gods own
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:64298:113"/> people many times cannot tell how to wait for it. We are very apt to be impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient till <hi>deliverance</hi> comes. Every body concludes that <hi>deliverance</hi> is an excellent thing. Well now this Freedom is <hi>delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance;</hi> we ſhall be all <hi>delivered,</hi> if we be made Free by Chriſt. I don't tell you from what yet, I am not come to that; therefore I ſpeak as yet in a general way.</p>
               <p>Again, Another name by which this Freedom is called, is <hi>Redemption, Rom.</hi> 3. 24. and thoſe that are made Free by Chriſt, are very often in the Scripture ſaid to be <hi>redeemed.</hi> Now the word <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption</hi> properly ſignifies the buying back again of things or perſons, that were alienated from the right owner, by being gotten into Bondage. Hence it appears what an excellent thing this Freedom by Chriſt is, in that it is ſet out by this word, 'tis a bringing of out of us Captivity; a bringing of us back to God, who is our right owner; 'tis a fetching of us out of the Houſe of Bondage, an <hi>opening of the priſon,</hi> as 'tis called, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 61. 11. this Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom by Chriſt is a <hi>Goal-delivery:</hi> You may fitly apply that Scripture to this in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 107. 10. to 17. when the poor wretch is caſt into ſome loathſom Priſon, and there
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:64298:114"/> he ſits in darkneſs, and 'tis ſuch a darkneſs as is the very <hi>ſhadow of Death,</hi> and he is not only thus, but he is bound too, and that not with Cords, but with Iron; and there his very heart is brought down, all his ſpirits, and courage, and ſtrength, are gone out with the miſery he undergoes. I ſay, when 'tis thus with a poor wretch, oh, what a precious thing would it be to him to have Redemption! how doth his Soul long to be out of that condition! <hi>Iſa.</hi> 51. 14. <hi>The captive exile haſteneth that he may be looſed,</hi> he is in heaſt, that is, it is in his deſires, that he might be redeemed. Why now this Freedom by Chriſt brings <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption,</hi> it breaks the yoke of our op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion; by this we come out of the Iron Fornace.</p>
               <p>Again; Sometimes this Freedom is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Salvation,</hi> Tit. 2. 11. <hi>The Grace of God that bringeth Salvation hath appeared,</hi> &amp;c. The <hi>Greek</hi> word ſignifies a <hi>keeping ſafe:</hi> oh, what an excellent thing is that, to be <hi>kept ſafe,</hi> that come what can or will come, never ſuch dreadful ſtorms, never ſuch blackneſs, and darkneſs, and tempeſt, yet to be <hi>ſafe. Safety</hi> is ſo highly accounted of, that every body looks after it; for the outward man to be ſafe from
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:64298:114"/> poverty, and ſafe from infection, and ſafe from falling, and ſafe from fire, and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> They take a World of care to be ſafe, if they are afraid of Thieves; oh, how they will watch! and if they do but ſuſpect that any danger is near them, how circumſpect they'l be to prevent it, and all becauſe they deſire to be <hi>ſafe!</hi> and if that people would but look about them thus, and be careful in the matters of their Souls, oh how well would it be! but here generally people fear no dangers, no, tho we cry <hi>Fire, Fire,</hi> to ſinners, and tell them there is a deep Pit of Damnation before them, and they'l certainly fall into it, if they don't take heed; yet here they are inſenſible; only here, where there is the greateſt danger, they fear the leaſt; and tho they will thank any body from their hearts, that will forewarn them of outward dangers, and count them their great friends, and tell them, Well, if had not been for you, at ſuch a time I might have been drowned, or have broke my neck, and have been killed outright; I might have been loſt if I had had a hundred lives; yet they don't care to hear of their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and eternal dangers; and the more they are told of them, the more ſome diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:64298:115" rendition="simple:additions"/> thoſe that warn them; the ready way to get ſome mens hatred, is to ſhew the greateſt love to them; what greater love can there be expreſſed to a ſinner by any man, than to give him a friendly warning that he do not loſe his Soul by living in ſin? and yet for this, ſome will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come enemies, <hi>Joh.</hi> 7. 7.</p>
               <p>Again, Another excellent name by which this Freedom is called, is <hi>Reſt,</hi> Mat. 11. 28. <hi>Come unto me all ye that labour, and are heavy laden, and I will give you Reſt,</hi> that is, I will ſet you Free. Now what a precious thing is Reſt, this is ſuch a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious thing that Heaven it ſelf is compared to it, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. 9. To <hi>have no Reſt,</hi> you know what a ſad condition this is, <hi>Rev.</hi> 14. 11. Oh, what would a man give for <hi>Reſt</hi> that cannot ſleep, or that is quite ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; how refreſhing and comfortable is it, if he can get but a little of it! how thankfully will ſome ſpeak when they have been without it a great while! oh, they will ſay, Bleſſed be God they have got ſome Reſt, what a Mercy is this! yea ſo 'tis indeed; you that can go to your Beds at Night, and find Reſt there, don't forget to be thankful when you awake, 'tis a great mercy: Yea, but then what a great mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:64298:115"/> is this Freedom by Chriſt? what an excellent thing is that which is Reſt <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed?</hi> Oh! take heed, don't forget this <hi>Reſting place, Jer.</hi> 50. 6. I remember 'twas the Speech of <hi>Naomi</hi> to <hi>Ruth</hi> when ſhe was propounding a good match to her, Ruth 3. 1. <hi>My daughter ſhould I not ſeek Reſt for thee, that it may be well with thee?</hi> And then ſhe directs her how to order her matters, that ſhe might get <hi>Boaz</hi> her Kinſman to be her Husband, <hi>v.</hi> 2. She was a poor Woman, and brought to great wants, and ſo was fain to go a gleaning, which was next to going a beging; but her Mother in Law, made no doubt that if ſhe could but get ſuch a rich and good Husband as <hi>Boaz</hi> was, that would be a condition of <hi>Reſt</hi> for her; and then ſhe would do well: So that when ſhe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded ſuch a one as <hi>Boaz</hi> to Match with, there were many arguments included in it, to ſtir her up to look out to get him. One was, that her was a <hi>good man;</hi> he would be a gracious Husband for her: ſhe would not caſt her ſelf away by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Married to him, but ſhe would be well beſtowed. For this <hi>Boaz</hi> was a man that feared God; his whole carriage in the buſineſs after wards declares it. Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:64298:116"/> Argument was this, That he was <hi>rich</hi> too: for ſo he was; he had a great Eſtate, as you may ſee in this ſtory; he was ſo rich, that beſides a great deal he had alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, he was able to purchaſe more, <hi>cap.</hi> 4. 9. ſo that if ſhe had him, ſhe would have a <hi>purchaſing Husband;</hi> he was ſo rich. And then a third Argument, that ſhe uſes was this, That he was one that was <hi>near of kin</hi> to her; for in the caſe that <hi>Ruth</hi> was now, in the next Kinſman had right to Marry her: And then add this to all that ſhe tells her, that ſhe was now in a <hi>reſtleſs</hi> condition; 'twas ſo with her, that ſhe had great need of ſuch an Husband as this was; and if ſhe could but get him, oh there would be Reſt, then ſhe would be well, ſhe need take no further care for <hi>her.</hi> I have briefly opened this ſtory thus, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is of ſuch excellent uſe to the thing which I have in hand. Oh poor ſinners! I may apply all this to you, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning your matching with Chriſt. If you would have a good Husband for your Souls, one that is <hi>holy</hi> and full of grace, why this is <hi>he:</hi> If you would have one that hath a <hi>great Eſtate,</hi> why this is <hi>he.</hi> If you marry with Chriſt, you'l have a <hi>purchaſing</hi> Husband of him. Never was
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:64298:116"/> there ſuch a purchaſer as this is; this is one that hath purchaſed <hi>Heaven it ſelf</hi> for believers. And then he is your <hi>near Kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man;</hi> he is become a kin to us, by taking our nature unto him; he hath a Body now in Heaven that is of kin to mankind. And then for <hi>your</hi> parts, you are in a <hi>reſtleſs condition;</hi> ſo full of Miſery, ſo full of Poverty, ſo full of Iniquity, that there is no true <hi>Reſt</hi> to be gotten where you are; but if you do but match with this Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band Chriſt, you will have <hi>Reſt;</hi> it will be well with you; his Freedom is Reſt, that ſame excellent thing <hi>Reſt:</hi> Yea, 'tis a <hi>glorious Reſt,</hi> as 'tis called, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 11. 10. Oh! call upon your Souls now, and ſay, My Soul, <hi>ſhould I not ſeek Reſt for thee, that it may be well with thee?</hi> Oh, that you could be reſtleſs till you have got this <hi>Reſt!</hi> you are ſo in the truth of your condition; but oh that you could be ſo in your ſpirits, and in your deſires, and in your endeavours, and take encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to be ſo from what you find here re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded concerning <hi>Ruth.</hi> You ſee when ſhe ſet upon the work of getting this <hi>Boaz</hi> for her Husband, how ſhe proſpered; ſhe went and lay at his feet, <hi>verſ.</hi> 7, 8. of <hi>cap.</hi> 3. and then <hi>verſ.</hi> 9. ſhe prayed him to
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:64298:117"/> pread his Skirt over her, <hi>i. e.</hi> to become an Husband to her; and ſee how this wrought, and how the heart of <hi>Boaz</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to her; firſt, he highly commends her for her pitching upon <hi>him,</hi> that ſhe would be ſatisfied with <hi>none but him, v.</hi> 10. and then he promiſes her, that he would grant her all her requeſt, <hi>v.</hi> 11. and then in the next, <hi>chap.</hi> he doth ſolemnly Marry her. So the Lord Jeſus is inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and willing to Marry you. Go and try if he be not. Lye you at his feet, beg earneſtly that he would ſpread his Skirt over you, ſee if he do not; can you think that he is not willing; when inſtead of your coming to woo Chriſt (as <hi>Ruth</hi> here did <hi>Boaz),</hi> Chriſt comes to woo you? he would fain be your Saviour, be your Husband; he tells you ſo, and all, that when you have him, you may have <hi>Reſt,</hi> and that it may be well with you; which it never will till you have him.</p>
               <p>Again, Another Name by which this Freedom by Chriſt is ſet forth, to ſhew the excellency of it, is <hi>Health,</hi> or Heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Iſa. 53. 5. <hi>With his ſtripes we are healed;</hi> we get <hi>Health</hi> by them, 'tis all one with this Freedom here: And <hi>Pſal.</hi> 67.
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:64298:117"/> 2. where this is prayed for, that it might be manifeſted to the World, and that the knowledg of Salvation by Chriſt might be ſpread all over the Earth (as it was to be in the days of the Goſpel); 'tis called <hi>Saving Health: That thy way may be known upon earth, thy ſaving health among all nations.</hi> Now you all know what an excellent thing <hi>Health</hi> is; ſome by the enjoying of it, and ſome by the want of it; this is ſuch a mercy that whatever one hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, yet if there be no <hi>Health</hi> with it, all is imbittered, it makes life it ſelf bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denſom, and uncomfortable; and tho ones condition in the World be but poor in other reſpects; yet ſometimes you ſhall hear people ſay, but thanks be to God they have their <hi>Health</hi> tho, and as long as they have that, they may make the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſhift. <hi>Health,</hi> beloved, is <hi>more then a ſingle mercy,</hi> 'tis a double, treble, yea a tenfold, yea a hundredfold mercy, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it helps us to take the comfort, and taſte the ſweetneſs of all elſe; what is all the World to a man that is very Sick, or near to Death? <hi>Health</hi> is ſuch an excellent thing, that no body can tell what to do with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it. 'Tis an uſual expreſſion or cry with perſons that have it not, and are Sick,
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:64298:118"/> and are in pain; oh, what ſhall I do? and you know how they will be enquiring of this Neighbour, and that, which comes to viſit them, whether they can tell what they ſhould take; and they'l ſend to the Phyſician, and he muſt come and ſee them; and tho he preſcribes ſharp or loathſom things, yet they'l take them; they'l Purge, they'l Vomit, they'l Bleed, they'l Sweat, and all to have their <hi>Health again.</hi> Well, now this is the nature of this Freedom by Chriſt, 'tis <hi>Health;</hi> if a man be Sick at his <hi>very heart,</hi> 'twill recover him; if he be never ſo like to dye, I mean by it, if he be never ſo like to be damned, which is the Second and the worſt Death: If he never ſo much faint away in his Spirits, through the Anguiſh and Terror of a wounded Conſcience; yet this <hi>Freedom</hi> by Chriſt, if he believes in it, will fetch him again; if he hath never ſo many ſores this will bind him up. There are ſome very obſervable things about Chriſts man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of healing, while he was here upon Earth; I would deſire you to take much notice of them, becauſe the thing that we are to gather from it, is what this ſame <hi>bealing Freedom</hi> by Chriſt will do.</p>
               <pb n="215" facs="tcp:64298:118"/>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Obſerve,</hi> That Chriſts manner of healing perſons that were diſeaſed, was <hi>by touching;</hi> he touched them, and they touched him, See <hi>Matth.</hi> 8. 3, 15. There Chriſt touched them; and in <hi>Mark</hi> 6. 56. There you find that they touched Chriſt: now there is much to be learnt by this. If you would have healing by Chriſt, he muſt touch <hi>you</hi> by the <hi>finger of his Spirit,</hi> (for 'tis ſpiritual healing that we are now ſpeaking of; and therefore the touch muſt be ſpiritual now, both in him and you), and you muſt touch <hi>him</hi> by the <hi>finger of Faith;</hi> for you muſt have <hi>Faith</hi> to be healed. See what a Queſtion Chriſt put to the Blind men, Matth. 9. <hi>verſ.</hi> 27. <hi>Two blind men followed him, crying, and ſaying, Thou Son of David, have mercy on us:</hi> then v. 28. you have his Queſtion, <hi>Believe ye that I am able to do this?</hi> And their Anſwer, <hi>They ſaid unto him, Yea, Lord.</hi> And what followed upon it, you read afterwards, verſ. 29, 30. <hi>Then touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed he their eyes, ſaying, According to your faith be it unto you: And their eyes were opened.</hi> So you have ſuch and ſuch ſpiritual diſeaſes; you have inward blindneſs, and inward deafneſs, and
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:64298:119"/> inward hardneſs; but do you believe that Chriſt can heal you? Doth not unbelief keep off the cure in you? Do you touch him by Faith? Chriſt and you, as I ſaid but now, muſt touch one another, that you may be healed: He by his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and you by your Faith. Beloved, this finger of the Spirit is ſuch a thing, that by it Chriſt can touch you, tho you be upon <hi>Earth;</hi> and on the other ſide, this finger of Fath is ſuch a thing, that by it you can touch Chriſt, tho he be <hi>in Heaven.</hi> If Chriſt doth but ſend his Spirit to you, it will tell you where you are; it will find you out, and it will give you ſuch <hi>a touch</hi> as you'l never forget; and when Chriſt hath thus touched you, he will help you to touch him, he will work Faith in you by his Spirit. Oh! look after theſe touches, and don't think you are healed if Chriſt hath not touched you, and you have not touched him.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Obſerve, that as they muſt <hi>touch</hi> him that would be healed; ſo they were heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed if they did <hi>but touch</hi> him, <hi>Matth.</hi> 9. 20, 21. Here is a great deal of comfort for weak believers. Many a poor Soul is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to think, that becauſe they have not Faith in that ſtrength and growth, and
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:64298:119"/> full aſſurance that ſome have, therefore, alas! they ſhall get nothing from Chriſt; do no good at all with that poor, ſorry, ſtaggering Faith of theirs. Truly, poor Soul, I wiſh thy Faith were ſtronger; but I tell thee, if thou haſt but a grain of true Faith, tho it be never ſo weak, if it be but true, 'twill bring thee a cure; for 'twill <hi>touch</hi> Chriſt, if it be true, tho never ſo ſmall.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Obſerve, that <hi>as many</hi> as touched him, were healed, <hi>Mark</hi> 6. laſt words of the <hi>chapt.</hi> He did not turn away one that did it; he accepted of the weakeſt Faith; there is not one that comes to Chriſt ſhall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Obſerve, that they who touched him, were not <hi>almoſt</hi> healed by him, but they were healed <hi>perfectly, Matth.</hi> 14. 36. You that are the people of God, you have yet a great many weakneſſes, and imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; you can't ſay yet, I am well, my heart is clean enough. No, I know 'tis your grief that you are no better: Yea, but go on to touch Chriſt ſtill, keep the finger of Faith upon him, and you ſhall find by that time he hath done, that you ſhall be made perfectly whole; he hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:64298:120"/> to cure you already, and he will finiſh what he hath begun.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Obſerve, how quickly Chriſt healed them, <hi>Luke</hi> 13. 13. <hi>immediately,</hi> which ſhews what a ſpeedy Alteration the Lord Jeſus can make in your condition. 'Tis, it may be, very ſad with thy Soul now; but how ſoon, if he pleaſe, can he bring you to a better paſs? If he ſpeak but a word, 'twill be done; therefore wait with patience for a recovery and a reviving in thy Soul; think of this, it may be done <hi>immediately</hi> for ought I know: Why then ſhould I be out of hope?</p>
               <p n="6">6. Obſerve again, That Chriſt healed them of <hi>whatſoever</hi> Diſeaſes they had, <hi>Matth.</hi> 4. 23, 24. 'tis that which lies ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times very heavy upon the Souls of ſome: What ſuch a ſinner as I be recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved! I find mercy! one in my condition! why my caſe is an extraordinary caſe for Sin and Guilt, and Miſery. But mind here, he healed <hi>all manner</hi> of Sickneſſes; as if the <hi>Evangeliſt</hi> ſhould have ſaid, he heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>all manner of ſinners</hi> that come to him, for that is the ſpiritual meaning of it, ſee <hi>Matth.</hi> 12: 31:</p>
               <p n="7">7. Obſerve, that he healed thoſe who could not be healed of <hi>any other, Luke</hi> 8.
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:64298:120"/> 43. the poor Womans caſe was deſperate as to any other Phyſician, ſhe <hi>could not</hi> be healed. Very like the words may be deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the ſame language that her Phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans had ſpoken to her; they might tell her when they had tried all means, Now you <hi>cannot</hi> be healed, and yet Chriſt heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her. Beloved, a ſinner may be given up for <hi>Deſperate;</hi> and a Soul may give up its caſe for <hi>Deſperate,</hi> and yet healing may come from Chriſt for all that. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore take heed both to others, tho they be very wicked, and as to your ſelves too, tho your condition be very ſinful, and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſad, that you do not caſt away all hope, tho it looks never ſo much like a conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that <hi>cannot</hi> be healed; take heed, don't undervalue Chriſts skill: when thou ſayeſt <hi>this</hi> ſinner <hi>cannot</hi> be turned, this condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <hi>cannot</hi> be got out of, thou forgetteſt how thou undervalueſt Chriſts skill.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Obſerve again, You find that when Chriſt had healed them, they had an <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward perceiving</hi> of it, See <hi>Mark</hi> 5. 29, 33. ſhe <hi>felt</hi> in her, ſhe <hi>knew</hi> what was done in her. Oh! how ignorant are many of this, who profeſs that they have come to Chriſt, and have touched him, and ſome of them I believe have done ſo: Ah! but
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:64298:121"/> how many be there, even of Gods own Children, that have not that feeling, that knowledg of it, as to ſay, Sure enough I have been healed by Chriſt, otherwiſe it could not be thus and thus with me, as it is, bleſſed be God; I feel the healings of Chriſt within me. I know there is ſome feeling, ſome ſenſe of it in thoſe who are healed; and therefore examine, you that think you are in this healed condition; What do you feel? What Knowledg have you of any ſuch thing done in you? I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve in mine own experience, that when it comes to this cloſe queſtion, If a Miniſter of Chriſt ask ſome, who are too ready to look upon themſelves as converted when they are not; Well, pray what have you inwardly found or felt of ſuch a change? They have nothing to ſay.</p>
               <p n="9">9. Again obſerve, what a running, and ſtriving, and crowding there was by them, to come to this healer, See <hi>Mark</hi> 3. 9, 10. and <hi>chap.</hi> 6. 54, 55, 56. Oh! that we could ſee this forwardneſs and diligence in people, to get ſpiritual healing from Chriſt! Oh Friends, did they do thus for their bodies, and will you not do it for your Souls? Chriſt ſuffered it to be thus when he was upon Earth, that they that
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:64298:121"/> came for healing, ſhould <hi>throng</hi> in up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, to teach us how earneſtly we ſhould make out to him for our precious Souls.</p>
               <p n="10">10. One thing more obſerve, That Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt would certainly have us to look after this healing by him in a ſpecial man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner on the <hi>Lords dayes,</hi> and while we are gathered in religious Aſſemblies; for you ſhall find how he went into their Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagogues, and healed on the Sabbath-days, See <hi>Luke</hi> 13. 10, <hi>&amp;c. Mark</hi> 1. 21, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Beloved, I beſeech you mind this well, for I bring it to you, that you may be very careful to improve your Lords days op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities of meeting together in Gods Worſhip and Ordinances, that you may get healing from Chriſt on theſe days. Beloved, theſe are ſuch kind of days as you read of Luke 5. 17. Wherein <hi>the power of the Lord is preſent to heal</hi> perſons. Oh! that <hi>this</hi> day in this Aſſembly you may have healing from Chriſt.</p>
               <p>6. Another excellent name by which this Freedom is called, is <hi>Light, Iſa.</hi> 9. 2. <hi>The people that walked in darkneſs, have ſeen a great Light: they that dwell in the land of the ſhadow of death, upon them</hi>
                  <pb n="222" facs="tcp:64298:122"/> 
                  <hi>hath the light ſhined.</hi> This Scripture is a Prophecy, that Freedom by Chriſt ſhould be made known unto us blind and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant Gentiles; and the Apoſtle tells them there in 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2: 9. who were now par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of this Freedom, that God had cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led them out of darkneſs into his <hi>marvellous</hi> Light. What a <hi>marvellous</hi> Light this is, we ſhall ſpeak ſome thing to it, when we come to ſhew the many wonders that are to be obſerved in this Freedom; but for the preſent let us conſider a little the name it ſelf. <hi>Light,</hi> what an excellent thing is that! Eccl: 11. 7. <hi>Truly the Light is ſweet.</hi> The excellency of Light will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear by comparing it with it's contrary, and by conſidering it in it ſelf: what's the contrary to Light? Why <hi>Darkneſs.</hi> Now you know that this is a thing in which there is neither Beauty, nor Order, nor Safety, nor Comfort; 'twas one of <hi>Egypts</hi> Plagues, and the laſt but one of all the Plagues they had; which ſhews what a dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful thing 'tis; the ſaddeſt Afflictions out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward or inward are compared to <hi>Darkneſs:</hi> The Devil is called the Prince of <hi>Darkneſs;</hi> Hell it ſelf is called the place of <hi>Darkneſs.</hi> And then if you conſider Light as it is in it ſelf, why 'tis one of the deſirableſt things
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:64298:122"/> that is in the World. You have not a houſe but they will have Windows in it to let in <hi>Light;</hi> this was the firſt thing which God made; and as ſoon as he had made it, he commended it, Gen. 1. 3, 4. <hi>God ſaw the Light that it was good.</hi> God himſelf is ſaid to <hi>dwell in Light,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 16. Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven it ſelf is compared to <hi>Light, Col.</hi> 1. 12. 'tis called <hi>the Inheritance of the Saints in Light.</hi> Now this Freedom by Chriſt is <hi>Light,</hi> and therefore ſure 'tis an excellent Freedom. To make out this, let us conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a little what Light does, and you ſhall ſee that this Freedom by Chriſt doth the ſame things in a ſpiritual may.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Light is an <hi>awakening</hi> thing; you know tho perſons be never ſo faſt aſleep in the dark, yet when the Light breaks in, that awakens them, it makes them think 'tis time to riſe; they ſtart out of their Beds when the Light compaſſes them about, they'l ask what a clock 'tis, and they are afraid they have lien a bed to long. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved, ſpiritually thus 'tis with this Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom by Chriſt, when it gets into a Soul, it may be called Light: For oh! how it awakens the Soul! it calls it up to work for Eternity, it makes the Soul aſhamed
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:64298:123"/> to think how long it hath been a bed in car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ſecurity; 'tis a rowzing thing when it takes hold on the heart; it ſpeaks to a man, according to that in Prov. 6. 9. <hi>How long wilt thou ſleep, O ſluggard? when wilt thou ariſe out of thy ſleep?</hi> Or according to that which the Ship-maſter ſaid to <hi>Jonah,</hi> when there was a mighty Tempeſt in that Sea, and <hi>Jonah</hi> was gone down into the ſides of the Ship, and he lay and was <hi>faſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſleep,</hi> Jon. 1. 6. <hi>What meaneſt thou, O ſleeper? ariſe, call upon thy God,</hi> &amp;c. This Freedom by Chriſt ſhews them that have it, that they muſt be no ſleepers; mind two Scriptures, 1 Theſ. 5. 5, 6, 7, 8. <hi>Ye are all children of light,—Therefore let us not ſleep as do others,</hi> &amp;c. And mark in the <hi>9th</hi> verſ. what a Reaſon he gives for this, <hi>For God hath not appointed us to wrath: but to obtain ſalvation by our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> As if he ſhould ſay, why Freedom by Chriſt is come, therefore no ſleeping for us now. See alſo Rom. 13. 11, 12. <hi>And that knowing the time, that now it is high time to awake out of ſleep: for now is our ſalvation nearer then when we believed. The night is far ſpent, the day is at hand: let us therefore caſt off the works of darkneſs, and let us put on the armour of</hi>
                  <pb n="225" facs="tcp:64298:123"/> 
                  <hi>light.</hi> Mark how he brings it in <hi>know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the time.</hi> As if he ſhould ſay, Do you know what a time this is? that 'tis a time of Freedom by Chriſt, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore 'tis not only <hi>time,</hi> but <hi>high time</hi> to awake out of ſleep, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This is the Reaſon, why thoſe that are in the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of an unconverted condition, ſleep as they do, becauſe the <hi>Light</hi> of this <hi>Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> hath not broken in upon them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Light is a <hi>diſcovering</hi> thing, it brings things into view that were hid before; you know when you are in a dark Room, it may be there be many things there, yea perhaps things that are very precious, and that would wonderfully affect one with the Beauty and Luſter of them; but to one that is in the dark, 'tis as if there were no ſuch things; but when Light comes, that diſcovers them. So when a Soul comes into this ſtate of Freedom, then, and not till then, the Beauty and Glory of heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things appears. You have an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent place for this, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 3, 4, 5, 6. Ah <hi>Sirs!</hi> there's a Goſpel among you, a glorious Goſpel, as 'tis called, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 11. There's a Chriſt preached to you, a precious Chriſt; but as long as any of you are in the Bondage of Sin, you know
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:64298:124"/> not what they mean; you never ſaw a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing in them, to raiſe your hearts to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them, to beſtow your beſt affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons upon them; alas, can the Children of Night and of Darkneſs ſee any Beauty in Chriſt, tho he be never ſo beautiful; or any need of Chriſt tho he be never ſo needful? If I ſhould reckon up ſpiritual things one after another, I might ſhew you how the Scripture ſaith, That they who are in this Bondage do not know ſo much as one of them; why, the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> alas! they do not know them, <hi>Matth.</hi> 22. 29. No, tho they can read them, they don't know them; tho they can talk of them, they don't know them. Again, the <hi>ways of God,</hi> alas, they don't know them neither, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3. 10. Again, the <hi>Spirit</hi> that dwells in the Saints, they don't know him, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14. 17. Again, <hi>God</hi> that made them, why they know him not, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17. 25. Again, the <hi>Children</hi> of God, they don't know theſe neither, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 1. But there is not one that is brought into this Freedom, but hath ſome ſpiritual diſcerning of heavenly things; Unto them <hi>'tis given to know the Myſteries of the Kingdom of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="227" facs="tcp:64298:124"/>
               <p n="3">3. Light is a preſerving thing, it keeps a man from manifold dangers which they who are in darkneſs are expoſed to, <hi>Joh:</hi> 11. 9, 10. Darkneſs is full of dangers; there be many Pits, and Snares, and Stum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling-blocks in the way, which may be ruſht upon before one is aware, from which the Light will ſecure one. So this Freedom by Chriſt is a great defence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Soul-miſchiefs; they that are in this State are ſaid to be <hi>preſerved</hi> in Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Jude</hi> 1. and to have <hi>eſcaped</hi> the corruption that is in the World through Luſt, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 4. They are inabled to ſee through this Light; there is ſuch a Sin and ſuch a Sin that many have been overthrown by, and therefore I will take heed of it; they do in ſome meaſure ſee the Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and the Occaſions to ſin, that others do not take notice of: Being entred into this Freedom, they are poſſeſſed with a holy fear of offending God, and with a godly Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly over their hearts and ways; and tho 'tis true they have a fall now and then, yet it is not ſo dangerous; they don't bruiſe and batter their Souls, and their Conſciences as others do. Hence you have thoſe gracious Promiſes which are made to ſuch as cloſe with Chriſt, of being
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:64298:125"/> kept from evil ways, See <hi>Prov.</hi> 2. 8, 9, 10, 11, 12. <hi>&amp;</hi> 3. 23. <hi>&amp;</hi> 4. 12.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Light is an <hi>adorning</hi> thing, it caſts a Beauty and Brightneſs upon things when it ſhines upon them. So this Freedom by Chriſt: Oh, how it adorns them that have it; it adorns them ſo, that it makes them all <hi>new</hi> Creatures, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 17. There is a beauty in the eyes of men, and there is a beauty in the eyes of God: Now there be many that are beautiful<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in the eyes of men, and yet God ſees no beauty in them, for he is not taken with the outward appearance of things, as we are; but now beloved, God himſelf ſees a beauty in all thoſe perſons that are made Free by Chriſt, this is a thing that doth adorn us in his eye: And therefore when Chriſt looks upon his redeemed Spouſe, obſerve how he ſpeaks to her, Cant. 4. 7. <hi>Thou art all fair my love, there is no ſpot in thee: Thou haſt raviſhed my heart, my Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, my Spouſe, thou haſt raviſhed my heart with one of thine eyes, with one chaine of thy neck.</hi> And <hi>chap.</hi> 6. 5. the former words of it, and <hi>chap.</hi> 7. 6. 'Tis the Glory of this Freedom, that as it makes Chriſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent <hi>to us,</hi> ſo it makes us excellent <hi>to Chriſt:</hi> we ſee a preciouſneſs in <hi>him</hi> above
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:64298:125"/> all others; and he ſees a preciouſneſs <hi>in us</hi> above all others too; we cannot but love him, we are ſo taken with <hi>him;</hi> and he cannot but love us, he is ſo taken <hi>with us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. Light is a <hi>rejoycing</hi> thing; as dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs breeds ſadneſs, ſo Light begets cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, <hi>Prov.</hi> 15. 30. 'tis a thing that raiſes up the ſpirits. So this Freedom by Chriſt is Light upon that account; it brings joy to the heart where it comes. No ſooner was the Jaylor entred into this, but 'tis ſaid he <hi>rejoyced, Acts</hi> 16. 34. 'tis ſuch a condition that one would even wonder that any that are in it ſhould e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be <hi>ſorry;</hi> and that any that are out of it ſhould ever be <hi>merry:</hi> And ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily there be but two Reaſons why any that are in this condition do not rejoyce, pray mark them. Either,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe, they <hi>fear they are not in this condition;</hi> for one may be in it, and not know it with ſuch aſſurance and certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty as to put him out of fear: Now fear is a great hindrance to joy and comfort. You ſhall obſerve many times that's the great thing that caſts down many a poor Soul, whoſe condition we look upon as
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:64298:126"/> very comfortable in it ſelf: Oh! they cannot ſay but ſuch and ſuch things have been done in them, that they ſpeak ſome hope; but when they conſider what a rare work a right work is, and how de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful the heart is, and how far they may go, and yet be an hypocrite: Oh! then how they fear whither yet a ſaving change hath paſſed upon them; they would rejoyce, yea, and ſing aloud, and ſhout for joy, if they did but know upon ſure grounds that they belonged to Chriſt; but alas there's their fear. They that are aſſured they are in Chriſt, they rejoyce, and well they may; but it cannot be expected that they ſhould do ſo that <hi>fear</hi> it. Fear hath tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in it, and ſeeing it is ſuch a tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting thing, tho a Soul ſhould be in Chriſt, yet till 'tis in ſome good meaſure ſatisfied about it, and perſwaded that 'tis ſo, ſorrow muſt needs be the moſt prevailing thing there. And therefore if you would have the comfort of this condition, you muſt not only <hi>be</hi> in it, but labour to <hi>ſee</hi> that you are in it, and then you would find that this Freedom by Chriſt is a moſt rejoycing thing to your Souls, 'tis your uncertainty that hinders your joy, See <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 1, 2. <hi>We have peace,</hi> &amp;c. Mark
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:64298:126"/> that word we <hi>have</hi> it! and what then? why we <hi>rejoyce,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Or, becauſe they <hi>forget</hi> they are in this condition. I mean for the preſent 'tis out of their minds. When the Saints are under ſadneſs they are under a forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs; and 'twas their forgetting where they are, that was the great cauſe that brought them to it. As now to make it out thus; It may be a Child of God, and one that knows, for the main, he is a Child of God, and hath ſuch grounds for his perſwaſion as will undeniably hold good by the word of God; and therefore as to the main he knows that he hath not built his Houſe upon the Sand, but upon the Rock. Yet I ſay, it may be this Child of God for all this, hath turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed again to folly, and is guilty of ſuch and ſuch back-ſlidings, and he hath not kept up his Communion with God by ſuch a cloſe walking as he ought; and ſo now his comfort and his joy is gone, and he is now brought to ſuch a paſs as <hi>David</hi> was in his Soul, there in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51. by reaſon of the ſins that he had fallen into, and is fain to pray over his Petitions; becauſe now 'tis his own caſe, <hi>ver.</hi> 8, 9, 10, 11, 12. and I pray what is it that hath brought him to
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:64298:127"/> this ſadneſs? Why truly, becauſe, by ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning thus he forgat where he was, he did not mind, as he ſhould have done; Why I am a Child of God, and in a ſtate of Grace; and therefore I muſt not return to theſe Sins, I muſt not yield to theſe Temptations, I muſt not grieve the holy Spirit by unbecoming walking; but alas he forgot this, and ſo ran himſelf firſt into ſin, and then into ſadneſs.</p>
               <p>And then again, another Child of God it may be, and that hath had good Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-Evidences of his being ſo, tho he perhaps hath not ſo gone away from God by the forementioned back-ſlidings; yet, (as it doth indeed ſometimes thus fall out), he hath his time of darkneſs too; and he is ſo ſad, he cannot tell what to do; why what's the great Reaſon now that his ſadneſs is thus upon him? The man, it may be, hath been very careful to keep up his Communion with God, and there's nothing in all the World that he hath been as much afraid of, as of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſing his loving Father, and yet ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times he cannot rejoyce: Well, what is the cauſe of his ſadneſs? Why now he forgets where he is, and whoſe Child he is, and what his Priviledges are, and what
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:64298:127"/> Promiſes are made to ſuch a one as he is, and what a Covenant God hath taken him into. If he could but remember himſelf, and ſtir up himſelf to ſet Faith a work up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on theſe things, and think, Why is my Countenance ſad, ſince I am the Son of a King? and why do I walk thus dejectedly, ſince the Lord loves me, and hath done ſuch great things for me, and will yet do greater? I ſay, if he could but well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member theſe things, and improve the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of them, would not he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce? Yes that he would to be ſure; but alas, he forgets for the preſent that he is in this comfortable condition, and ſo hath not the comfort of it; but when God helps him to remember, then the man will rejoyce again: See that remarkable place, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 63. 5, 6. <hi>David</hi> was now in a wilderneſs-condition, as the title ſhews, Well ſaies he here, but I ſhall rejoyce and praiſe thee again, <hi>My mouth ſhall praiſe thee with joyful lips;</hi> but which way muſt this joy come in: Oh! ſaies he, when I <hi>remember thee upon my bed,</hi> &amp;c. As if he ſhould haveſaid, If I could but get into this <hi>Remembrance, think</hi> upon what God is to me, and <hi>think</hi> upon what I am to him; this would do it. So that this ſame
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:64298:128"/> Freedom by Chriſt 'tis <hi>Light,</hi> 'tis a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing thing in it ſelf; only the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why many of Gods people dont't re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce in it, is either, becauſe they <hi>fear</hi> they are not in this condition, or they <hi>forget</hi> it.</p>
               <p>7. Another name by which this Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom is called, that ſets out the excellency of it, is <hi>Life.</hi> Now I need not much ſtand upon it, to ſhew you that <hi>Life</hi> is an excellent thing; what's the great care of people taken up about generally, but how to provide for their Life: Why have they ſo many earneſt thoughts, and why do they put themſelves upon ſuch unwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried labours as they do, but to provide for their <hi>Life?</hi> and when they are ſick, and fallen into ſome dangerous diſeaſe, what's the great, and the greateſt fear that then moſt have? Oh, that their <hi>Life</hi> will be gone; they prize <hi>Life;</hi> ſo that when we would ſet out the doing of a thing with the greateſt care, we uſe to expreſs it thus, We did it as for our <hi>Lives;</hi> and Life is ſuch a precious thing, that tho one lives in a great deal of pain and miſery, yet one is very loath to leave it. And we ſhew what an high eſteem we have of Life,
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:64298:128"/> by the rejoycing that we have in us, when any of our dear Relations have been dangerouſly ſick, and it hath pleaſed God that they have recovered again; oh, how glad are we that their <hi>Life</hi> is preſerved, that they ſhall continue longer with us; and then when any one of them are ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away by Death, why the ſorrow and grief that follows upon that, and the mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that we make for deceaſed Friends, confirms the truth of this, that Life is an excellent thing. Well, now this Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom by Chriſt is <hi>Life, Joh.</hi> 6. 33.—He giveth <hi>Life</hi> to the World: and chap: 5. 40. <hi>Ye will not come unto me that ye might have Life;</hi> that is, that you might have Freedom by me. And here I will ſpeak a little about this ſuitableneſs of this Name, how ſuitable it is that this Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom by Chriſt ſhould be called <hi>Life.</hi> You know Life puts a quickning Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple into them that have it, ſo doth this Freedom by Chriſt. Take notice of four things here.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It puts Life into our <hi>Souls.</hi> Souls do not live ſpiritually, and unto God, till they come into this Freedom, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 1. they are only ſuch as are intereſted
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:64298:129"/> in it, that are paſſed from Death to Life. Now to have a Soul that is dead within one, is a dreadful thing, and dead in the worſt ſenſe of all too; for the Soul to be dead, ſo as that it was never quickned. 'Tis true, Gods Children complain many times how dead <hi>their</hi> hearts are, and what great need they have of quickning; and oh, how much do they pray, that they might not be ſo dead as they are, as you ſhall ſee <hi>David</hi> often doth in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 25, 37, 40, 88, 107, 149, 154, 146, 159. Yea, but here is ſomething to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, that tho they are dead now, it may be, yet, they have been quickned; 'tis not a deadneſs that is from want of Life, but from want of livelineſs; but the deadneſs of thoſe that are not made Free by Chriſt, is ſuch that ſpeaks they were never quickned, and ſo their Souls are dead in the worſt ſenſe of all, they have no ſpiritual Life in them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This Fredom by Chrſt, it puts Life into <hi>Ordinances.</hi> There be ſome that find the Ordinances of Chriſt <hi>living</hi> things, as <hi>David</hi> ſaies, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 50. that he had found the word to be a living word; But who are they that have this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience? Why they which are made Free
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:64298:129"/> by Chriſt. I tell you, opportunities and means of Grace are other manner of things to them, than they are to others. You that are yet in the Bondage of Sin, you can ſpeak nothing that ſuch an Ordinance was bleſt to you at ſuch a time, and then another at another time; you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſay, Oh, the ſweet Communion that I had with God upon ſuch a Sabbath, and at ſuch a Sermon: You had ſuch a meeting with Jeſus Chriſt, and there were ſuch incomes from the Lord upon your Spirits, and ſuch drawings out of your hearts towards God, that you would not for the whole World but you had been there; but they that are made Free, there be thoſe amongſt them that can ſay ſo. I my ſelf heard a good man ſay once, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Prayer had been made to God by a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter in the company of ſome Chriſtians, who were together to that purpoſe, that he would not for all the World, but he had been there that time. And what do you think made <hi>David</hi> ſpeak that in Pſal. 84. 10. <hi>A day in thy courts is better than a thouſand:</hi> but becauſe he being one that belonged to Chriſt, found Life in the Ordinances? Oh! this is that which makes Gods people deſire to come to Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:64298:130"/> and to bleſs God for them, becauſe they do find Life conveyed to their Souls by them; that's a notable place in 1 Cor. 1. 18. That <hi>the preaching of the Goſpel is the power of God;</hi> to whom? why, <hi>to us that are ſaved, i. e.</hi> that are partakers of this Freedom by Chriſt, one of the names of which, as you have heard, is <hi>Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. This Freedom by Chriſt puts Life into our <hi>Communion;</hi> I mean that converſe which we have one with another, when we are in company together. Oh! if we are but made Free by Chriſt, and then come into one anothers ſociety, we are fitted by it for a living Diſcourſe together, for the having of ſome heart-warming con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference each with other. If there be two or three, or more of theſe perſons met together, 'tis to be hoped that they wont part one from another without ſome ſpiritual good to one anothers Souls. Their being thus related one to another in the Freedom that Chriſt gives to believers, will ſtir up their hearts to heavenly Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication, to help one another forward in the ways of God. They whoſe Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg and State this is, they carry <hi>ſpiritual heat</hi> about them, ſo that when they come
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:64298:130"/> into the company of others, they'l <hi>glow;</hi> as <hi>Mary</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> when they come together, <hi>Luke</hi> 1. they did as it were ſparkle in their gracious Diſcourſe one with another: When they that are in the Bondage of ſin, and ſtrangers to Chriſt, meet together, many times there you ſhall have the Language of Hell in their mouths, corrupt Communication, that diſcovers what they are, for their Speech bewrays them; and others of them, tho they are civilized, yet their talk 'twill be but earthly; oh, how their breath <hi>ſmells of the earth!</hi> If one ſtrive to get them into any diſcourſe that is above the things of this World, oh what dead companions they are! then you put them out of their Element; and if you would not have them ſpeak of things below, then you ſtop their mouths, they muſt ſay nothing: for they ſavour not the things of God. And tho 'tis true that Hypocrites may hold diſcourſe about good things, if they be perſons that have parts and gifts, and brain knowledg; yet, oh, there's no Life in that Communion; they are not in this ſtate of Freedom by Chriſt that ſhould put Life into it, and make them ſpeak of good things from a Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb facs="tcp:64298:131"/> within; but now Chriſts redeemed ones, they are <hi>living companions,</hi> and Communion with them is ſometimes as it were a <hi>corner of Heaven.</hi> If they can but once <hi>get into</hi> gracious diſcourſe together, as that is to often ſomewhat hard to do, what for want of coming oftner together, and by reaſon of deadneſs and backward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to ſuch a good work as edifying of one another in love when they are toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and for want of making it, (as ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they ſhould) the very deſign and end of their coming together, <hi>to build up one another in their moſt holy faith,</hi> &amp;c. But I ſay, if they can but once get <hi>into it,</hi> and eſpecially if they be not only true Chriſtians, but <hi>fervent:</hi> Oh, what com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable, profitable Communion will there be ſometimes between them, that their very hearts will be knit together by it, as it was between <hi>Jonathan</hi> and <hi>David,</hi> when they had had Communion together, <hi>The ſoul of Jonathan, was knit to the ſoul of David,</hi> and they loved one another as their own Souls. Now, the having of this living Communion together, is a thing which the Lord ſets a very high e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem upon. I ſpeak this to encourage Gods people to be more frequent and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb facs="tcp:64298:131"/> in it, then many of us are, See Mal. 3. 16. <hi>Then they that feared the Lord, ſpake often one to another, and the Lord hearkned, and heard it, and a book of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance was written before him, for them that feared the Lord, and that thought upon his name.</hi> This is a Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture that one would think ſhould make you even long to be more at this work; for mark what encouragement it carries in it. 1. The Lord: <hi>hearkned,</hi> as it were by way of <hi>Attention;</hi> and 2. <hi>Heard</hi> it, as it were by way of <hi>Acceptation:</hi> And then 3. This muſt not only be accepted, but it muſt be <hi>written.</hi> 4. Not in ſome looſe little Paper or Scroll, but in a <hi>Book.</hi> And 5. This Book muſt be called a Book of <hi>Remembrance,</hi> Remembrance muſt be the very name of it. And 6. That it might be remembred, it muſt not be laid away, but be <hi>before him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. This Freedom by Chriſt (we being intereſted in it), puts Life into our <hi>Hopes.</hi> If we have not this, all our Hopes of Mercy and Salvation are but dead Hopes; and you'l have no more benefit by them, then you will have of a man that you had great hopes in that he would be a mighty Friend to you in your diſtreſs, and
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:64298:132"/> you count upon it before your diſtreſs comes upon you, that certainly you ſhall have ſuch a Friend as paſſes of that man; and thus you go on, and when your great diſtreſs comes upon you, then you begin to look out for this Friend, that he may now do for you according to what he put you in hope he would do; and when you have enquired after him, and now have ſuch great need of help, you find the <hi>man is dead.</hi> So if you are not par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of this Freedom by Chriſt, hope what you will, it will come to nothing; and therefore what the Apoſtle tells the people of God they ſhould not do, I tell you that are not the people of God, that you <hi>ſhould</hi> do it, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 35. He ſaith they muſt by no means <hi>caſt away their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence.</hi> But, oh Sirs, you that are out of Chriſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> muſt by all means caſt away <hi>yours,</hi> you muſt throw it out for a caſt-away, and if you don't make that a caſt-away, that will help to caſt away you. What a ſlave to ſin! and yet hope to enjoy the Priviledges and Happineſs of them that are made Free by Chriſt! Away with it; In this Senſe I pray with all my heart that God Almighty would bring you to <hi>final deſperation.</hi> What ſinner<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> doſt thou think
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:64298:132"/> to live by a <hi>dead Hope? Obj.</hi> But how do you prove that my <hi>Hope</hi> is a <hi>dead</hi> Hope? <hi>Anſw.</hi> I will tell thee but even in three words. 1. Becauſe the Scripture calls it <hi>no</hi> Hope, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 12. As a dead man is as good as no man, ſo a dead Hope is no Hope. 2. Becauſe 'tis not a Hope to which God hath begotten thee, thou haſt given thy ſelf this Hope; but the living Hope is that which God hath given to his people by <hi>begetting of them</hi> to himſelf, by cauſing them to be born again, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 3. 3. Becauſe it doth not bring forth any purifying fruits; thou keepeſt thy Hope, and keepeſt thy ſins too; thy Hope and Holineſs do not go together; thou canſt allow thy ſelf in ways of wickedneſs, and mindeſt not a being like to God. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as 'tis otherwiſe with them that have the living Hope; they <hi>purifie themſelves as he is pure,</hi> 1 Joh. 3. 3.</p>
               <p>8. One thing more briefly, about this Freedom by Chriſt, as to another name by which 'tis called, ſerving to ſet out the excellency of it, and that is, 'tis called the <hi>Bleſſing of God.</hi> Now that's a preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous things indeed; What's all that we have, if we have not Gods Bleſſing with
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:64298:133"/> it? Why 'tis his Bleſſing that keeps us from his <hi>curſe;</hi> when God intended the greateſt good to <hi>Abraham,</hi> he ſummed it up in this, <hi>I will bleſs thee,</hi> Gen. 12. 2. And ſo when you wiſh the greateſt mercy to others, you pray that <hi>God would bleſs them;</hi> his bleſſing is the comfort of every Calling, of every Relation, of every Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. Why now this Freedom by Chriſt is <hi>Gods bleſſing,</hi> See Acts 3. ult. <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto you firſt, God having raiſed up his Son Jeſus, ſent him to bleſs you, in turning away every one of you from his iniquities.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all that I ſhall ſay upon it, is this, That if you have not this Freedom by Chriſt, you'l never have Gods <hi>bleſſing,</hi> and therefore you'l have Gods <hi>curſe,</hi> that will be your Portion. I grant that in ſome ſenſe you may be ſaid to have his bleſſings, that is, you may have outward mercies; in which reſpect God ſaid he would bleſs <hi>Iſhmael</hi> himſelf, tho he were the Son of the Bondwoman, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 20. But he may <hi>bleſs</hi> you thus, and yet you may be <hi>curſed</hi> for ever, and ſo you will be if Chriſt doth not make you Free: And oh Sirs, what a dreadful thing will it be to lye under the curſe of God to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity!
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:64298:133"/> Do you think you are ſtrong enough to bear ſuch a load as this is World without end? You may ſee ſome inkling of it now, what a dreadful thing this curſe is, if God doth but let fall a drop of it, upon a great Eſtate, how it moulders; or upon any perſon for his wickedneſs, what a forlorn Creature he becomes, as <hi>Cain.</hi> Why this is a thing that will dry one up to the roots, as the Fig-tree when Chriſt curſed it, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly <hi>it whithered away.</hi> But what then will it be in Hell where it ſhall be in its full force! But as for them who are intereſted in this Freedom by Chriſt, I may ſay to them, as in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 115. 15. <hi>You are bleſſed of the Lord which made heaven and earth.</hi>

               <head type="sub">
                  <hi>Concerning the Excellency of the perſon by whom this Freedom was perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>TO the Second, The excellency of this Freedom will appear, if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the excellent perſon by whom it was performed. You have already heard that this Freedom comes by Chriſt, and Chriſt is an excellent perſon indeed, he is excellent in his Names, and excellent in his Natures, and excellent in his Offices; his Life, his Death, his Satisfaction, Righteouſneſs, Interceſſion, are excellent. Beauty, Grace, are in him to perfection; he is ſo excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent that God and all Saints do ſet their beſt love upon him, that all the Riches, Hope and Happineſs of believers are laid up in him. So excellent, that he is the chiefeſt among ten thouſand, the Pearl of great price, in compariſon of whom all things are counted but loſs and dung.
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:64298:134"/> But my purpoſe is not here to treat of the excellency of Chriſt at large, (for that would fill up a Volume of it ſelf, there being no Subject of Divinity of a vaſter extent than this is.) But I ſhall confine my thoughts to the conſidering of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of his perſon, a little, as it relates to this Freedom, which we have in hand. He muſt needs be an excellent perſon, in that he performed this Freedom according to theſe twelve following things.</p>
               <p>1. In that he did it with ſo much <hi>power<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> Pſal. 93. 1. <hi>The Lord is cloathed with ſtrength, wherewith he hath girded himſelf.</hi> The Lord Jeſus Chriſt bewrayed no weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in his work from the beginning of it to the end. <hi>Our help was laid,</hi> as God ſaith in the Scripture, <hi>upon one that is mighty;</hi> he had ſuch an heavy burthen upon him, as was enough to have broken the back of a thouſand Worlds, but he ſtood under it; he could, as it were, ſwim in the whole Sea of his Fathers Wrath; one drop of which no meer man could bear without ſinking. What an excellent perſon muſt this needs be, that could grapple with the Divine Indignation, with <hi>red</hi> hot Juſtice, with all the Curſe
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:64298:135"/> of the Law, with the Powers of darkneſs, and not be daunted! Never was there a work ſo full of difficulty as this was; and yet Chriſt had enough to carry him through it; he met with many Enemies, but he overcame every one of them: Oh the ſtrength that he put forth in the work of our redemption! all the Devils in Hell were reſolved and combined, if it had been poſſible, to have worſted him, and to have ſpoiled the whole deſign of our Salvation, that it ſhould never have come to any thing; and there was not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing wanting, that they could do to hinder it; but this <hi>Lion of the Tribe of Judah</hi> was too ſtrong for the roaring Lion, and all his confederates; he wrought out our Freedom notwithſtanding oppoſition on all hands. And from this conſideration let me mind you, <hi>That good things muſt be ſet about and carried on with courage;</hi> for ſo you ſee Chriſt did what he had to do; difficulty did not diſcourage him. And as this did ſpeak the excellency of Chriſt in his work, ſo it ſpeaks the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of a Chriſtian in his work; that's a brave Chriſtian that won't be diſcouraged, that whatever he meets with in the way of Service aad Duty, his heart <hi>holds up</hi> ſtill.
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:64298:135"/> You are like to Chriſt, when 'tis thus with you: I know that you that are the people of God meet with difficulties, you have this and that which is hard to go through; but remember the Captain of your Salvation would not be daunted; take example from him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> But thou wilt ſay, it may be, But I am not ſo ſtrong as he was; he could come with that Power to his work that I have not.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> As thou haſt not Chriſts ſtrength, ſo neither haſt thou his work. 'Tis true, thou haſt thy work too, but it is not ſuch work as Chriſt in ſome reſpects had to do; thou never wert, nor ever ſhalt be called to ſuch great things as he was; but then mark, that Power of Chriſt by which he did his work, is alſo in him for the enabling of thee which believeſt to do thy work: So was it promiſed to the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 Cor. 12. 9. <hi>And he ſaid unto me, My grace is ſufficient for thee: for my ſtrength is made perfect in weakneſs.</hi> And becauſe of this, you ſee <hi>Paul</hi> would be ſo far from being diſcouraged at diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, that he would rather glory and
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:64298:136"/> take pleaſure in them; <hi>Moſt gladly, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore will I rather glory in mine infirmities, that the Power of Chriſt may reſt upon me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. In that he did it with ſo much <hi>Faith.</hi> What an excellent perſon muſt this needs be, that could go through ſuch a work ſo believingly as Chriſt did, and hold forth his Hope and Confidence in God his Father, notwithſtanding all the hard things he met with in procuring our Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom? How apt are we, when we are in diſtreſs and under deſertion, (tho all our afflictions and ſufferings are but a Fleabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in compariſon of what he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>went), to let go our hold of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, as you may ſee it even in thoſe who were very eminent for Grace, and had had great experience of the former goodneſs of God to them, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 77. 7, 8, 9. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 27. 1. But now here is one that had ſuch a Faith, that tho he were in the Red-Sea of his Fathers Wrath, and the deep Waters of his afflictions and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings did not do to him, as the Red Sea, that the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> came to, did to them; the waters of that were divided, and became a wall to them on their right
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:64298:136"/> hand, and on their left, ſo that they were in the very midſt of them, as upon dry ground; but the waters of Chriſts afflictions were overflowing, overwhelm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Waters, ſuch as plunged and drencht him into the deeps; his Soul was <hi>exceeding ſorrowful even unto Death,</hi> his very ſweat was like <hi>blood;</hi> yet, even then he could believe that God was his <hi>Father,</hi> and that he had an unſpeakeble Love to him. And this Faith of his had no mixture of unbelief, or of ſinful doubting, as ours hath; but 'twas a firm and full Faith, whereby he reſolved for ever to truſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly in God, let him do what he would with him and to him. Take two Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures for this among others, Iſa. 50. 7. <hi>The Lord will help me, therefore ſhall I not be confounded: therefore have I ſet my face like a flint; and I know that I ſhall not be aſhamed.</hi> Mark what Faith he had; he does not ſay now he is looking upon his ſufferings, (for ſo you are to conceive of him in this place) Oh! what ſhall I do, I ſhall never go through theſe Tribula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, I ſhall never be able to drink off this bitter Cup that is prepared for me; but he believes he ſhall, and that his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther would help him; he did not doubt
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:64298:137"/> of it: I <hi>know</hi> it, ſaies he; and in the confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of this, he doth as it were harden him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf againſt all the ſufferings of one kind and another, that he was to be called to, which is the meaning of that expreſſion, <hi>I have ſet my face like a flint.</hi> Another Scripture for the acting of his Faith, even in the ſight, and under the Senſe of the pains of Death, and Hell-torments in his Soul, you have in Pſal. 16. 8, 9, 10, 11. <hi>I have ſet the Lord always before me: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is at my right hand, I ſhall not be moved. Therefore my heart is glad,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Herein Chriſt is an Example to us, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all the Examples of other believers. No afflictions were like to Chriſts affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, and yet no Faith like to his Faith; the Tryals of other believers were very great, ſome of them; as the Tryals of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> and <hi>David,</hi> and their Faith was of a more than ordinary ſtature; but without diſparagement be it ſpoken, even the Faith of <hi>Abraham</hi> himſelf, was but a poor little weak Faith, in compariſon of this Faith that Chriſt had: All thoſe Worthies which you read of there in <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. who <hi>through Faith obtained a good</hi>
                  <pb n="253" facs="tcp:64298:137"/> 
                  <hi>report;</hi> they were Giants in reſpect of us, but they were Babes in reſpect of Chriſt. Now I ſay what an unparalel'd Example is Chriſt to us then, of truſting in God in the worſt condition! It may be you think, I hope I ſhould truſt God, if it were not ſo <hi>exceeding</hi> ſad with me as 'tis; alas! you cannot think how ſad 'tis with me, nor can I tell how to expreſs my miſery. Well, I am ſure 'tis not ſo ſad with thee as 'twas with Chriſt; and yet he truſted in God; the very enemies of Chriſt could take notice that he did, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 22. tho they wickedly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached him for it. And in deed this is the only ſinking thing in affliction, let it be never ſo great, that we cannot truſt God; and to what end hath God made the Promiſes, but that they ſhould be believed? Uſually when you doubt of a Friends helping of you in your ſtraits, 'tis becauſe you had not a <hi>Promiſe</hi> from him; it may be he put you in ſome hopes that he would help you, but for all that you doubt whether he will or no; but if you have a Promiſe from him, and he be a Friend indeed, and one that uſeth to keep his word, then you conclude upon it, Now I am ſure he will help me, he hath promiſed me faithfully to do it. Thus 'tis now with God, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards you that are his Children; you
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:64298:138"/> have got a <hi>Promiſe</hi> from him, that he will help you in your diſtreſſes; nay not only <hi>one,</hi> but <hi>many:</hi> Nay, you have got his <hi>Covenant,</hi> and his <hi>Oath</hi> for it. Oh! rely upon him, then, however 'tis or ſhall be with you.</p>
               <p>3. In that he did it with ſo much <hi>Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi> as one that fully knew and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood what he went about in this great undertaking. You ſhall find in Scripture, that his Wiſdom is much taken notice of, in reference to the work of our Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. He is called <hi>the Wiſdom of God,</hi> 1 Cor. 1. 24. and in Col. 2. 3. <hi>In whom are hid all the treaſures of wiſdom and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg.</hi> Mark, not only <hi>knowledg,</hi> but <hi>Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Knowledg;</hi> and that in ſuch abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, that he hath a <hi>treaſure</hi> of them, yea <hi>Treaſures,</hi> yea and <hi>all</hi> the Treaſures of them. And you ſhall ſee in the <hi>Old Teſtament,</hi> when it was propheſied of him that he ſhould come upon this work of giving Freedom and Salvation to us, how his diſcreet and wiſe carrying on of all things about it, is fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told, ſee <hi>Iſa.</hi> 11. 2, 3. <hi>chap.</hi> 52. 13. He dealt with ſuch Wiſdom, that he could tell how to deal with God for men, and with men for God; and to diſcharge the three great Offices of a Prophet, Prieſt,
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:64298:138"/> and King, with admirable underſtanding; and how to undermine and infatuate all the Policies of the Devil and the World, and to render their deepeſt deſigns againſt his Kingdom and Goſpel void, and of none effect, ſee 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 19, 20. and how to carry himſelf ſo wiſely, even amongſt his worſt Enemies, that they could have no juſt occaſion to ſpeak evil of him, tho they watched all that poſſibly could be to get advantages againſt him, both for his Actions, and Speeches, and Doctrine; and therefore what an excellent perſon muſt this needs be? And in this Wiſdom Chriſt doth all things ſtill that are yet to be done; he governs the World in Wiſdom, and as the great and good Shepherd, he feeds his Flock with Knowledg and Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; as a Paſtor that is after Gods own heart; and one great thing amongſt the reſt that he is made of God to his people, is <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 30. to inſtruct them, and teach them by his Spirit how to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have themſelves as the children of God, and to make them to know the Myſteries of the Kingdom of Heaven, and to be to them a Counſellor, according to that name which is given him, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 9. 6. And if his Diſciples are called at any time to
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:64298:139"/> bear a Teſtimony for him before the great ones of the World, he hath promiſed <hi>to give them a mouth, and wiſdom, which all their adverſaries ſhall not be able to gainſay or reſiſt,</hi> Luke 21. 15. And therefore Gods people ſhould learn to carry them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves wiſely in all their ways and walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and take heed of doing things raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and indiſcreetly, as thoſe that have Wiſdom for their pattern, ſee Eph. 5. 15, 17. <hi>See that ye walk circumſpectly, not as fools but as wiſe. Wherefore be ye not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, but underſtanding what the will of the Lord is.</hi> And the Wiſdom that you muſt do all things with, is not a carnal, politick craftineſs; but the Wiſdom which is from above; it muſt be the Scripture-wiſdom and <hi>ſpiritual</hi> Underſtanding.</p>
               <p>4. In that he did it with ſo much <hi>Love,</hi> Rev. 1. 5. <hi>He loved us, and waſhed us from our ſins in his own blood,</hi> Gal. 2. 20. He <hi>loved me, and gave himſelf for me;</hi> and in Tit. 3. 4. when the Apoſtle would briefly ſum up the whole work of Chriſt in giving this Freedom to us, he expreſſes it in theſe words, The <hi>kindneſs and love</hi> of God our Saviour towards man appeared. While he ſuffered, he was <hi>in love</hi> with thoſe for whom
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:64298:139"/> he ſuffered; when he died, he was <hi>in love</hi> with thoſe for whom he died; he did not barely do the work it ſelf, but he did it with ſuch affection to poor ſinners, as who ſhould ſay, he would have them ſee and know that they could not have a greater Friend then he was; he bare them upon his heart, while he bare their ſins up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Croſs. If he had not been an <hi>excellent perſon,</hi> the dreadful pains and ſufferings that our iniquities had put him to, would have made him for ever to loath us, and not to have endured the ſight of any man more; but his <hi>Love</hi> to us was neither removed nor abated for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing that he endured for our ſakes; neither was his Love <hi>to his Father</hi> in the leaſt diminiſhed by all the grief which he put him to, tho he bruiſed him, and took, as the Scripture ſaith, a kind of <hi>pleaſure</hi> and delight in the doing of it, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53. 10. Juſtice, as it were, requiring at this time that he ſhould afflict him willingly, which he doth not uſe to do, to the Children of Men; yet under all this, Chriſt kept up in perfect Love to God: And this you may obſerve from his manner of ſpeaking to God, when he was juſt ſtepping into his great ſuffering, when his Soul was exceeding
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:64298:140"/> ſorrowful, even unto Death, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26. 28. Yet mark <hi>v.</hi> 39. and 42. in what a loving way he ſpeaks to him, <hi>Father;</hi> and oh my <hi>Father, let this Cup paſs away from me.</hi> And oh what an Example is Chriſt in this to believers, to love the Lord and not to queſtion but that the Lord loves them, what ever he lays upon them! The Lord ſees a great proneneſs in us, to think it is not thus when his hand is heavy up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us, in that he hath left ſuch kind of ſayings as theſe upon record in Scripture; <hi>As many as I love, I rebuke and chaſten,</hi> and <hi>whom the Lord loveth, he chaſteneth; and ſcourgeth every ſon whom he receiveth.</hi> We are too ready to meaſure Gods affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to us by proſperity and ſmiles, and when things go as we would have them; but if we would be like to Chriſt, we muſt make account that God can be our Father, tho he beats us, and hides his Face from us.</p>
               <p>5. In that he did it with ſo much <hi>Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</hi> 'Tis not to be thought what Chriſt ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered in obtaining this Freeeom for us, from God, from Men, from Devils by their Temptations; yet under all, his Spirit was in a compoſed ſtill frame; he had not
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:64298:140"/> an hard thought of God for the low con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition which he had caſt him into; he had not an unbecoming, repining, diſcontented word dropping from his mouth, Iſa. 53. 7. <hi>He was oppreſſed, and he was afflicted, yet he opened not his mouth: He is brought as a lamb to the ſlaughter, as a ſheep before her ſhearers is dumb, ſo he opened not his mouth.</hi> God might do what he would to him, and put as much Gall, and Worm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood, and Wrath into his Cup as he pleaſed, and he would take it off: You may remember 'twas one of his patient Speeches, <hi>The Cup which my Father giveth me to drink, ſhall I not drink it?</hi> And men, they might ſay and do what they would againſt him, they might mock and revile, and ſcourge, and crucifie him, and he could take all with an inward peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſs; he could meet that Trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor <hi>Judas</hi> when he was come to betray him, and even then he could call him <hi>Friend, Matth.</hi> 26. 50. <hi>Job,</hi> you know, is worthily counted an excellent perſon for his Patience under Afflictions, and ſo he is pointed out to us, in <hi>Jam.</hi> 5. <hi>Ye have heard of the Patience of Job,</hi> and yet in Chriſt there are two things to be conſidered, which are far beyond what
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:64298:141"/> was in <hi>Job.</hi> 1. Chriſts Afflictions did out of meaſure exceed what <hi>Job</hi> was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed with; take all the Sufferings of the Saints in their Bodies and Souls too, and put them into one Scale, and put the Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings of Chriſt into the other, theſe will outweigh them as much as a Mountain will outweigh a Mole-hill; the greateſt Suffering-Saints in the Scriptures, ſuch as <hi>David, &amp;c.</hi> were but Types of Chriſt in his Sufferings; and ſo they had but the ſhadow of ſorrow in reſpect of him, whoſe ſorrows were ſo great, and of ſuch a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that he is ſaid to be a <hi>man of ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows,</hi> which is as much as to ſay, he was made up as it were of nothing elſe. 2. <hi>Jobs</hi> great Patience was mixed with great Impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience; tho he held out in his Tryals to Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration for a great while, yet afterwards he had his fits of diſtempered paſſion; and he that before had bleſſed God, tho he had ſtript him naked, at laſt <hi>opened his mouth and curſed his day.</hi> But Chriſt held on in Patience, and held out in Patience; he did not at all ſtain or blemiſh the ſtate of his Humiliation with a ſpot of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content in him; indeed that was done which the Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> exhorts us to, <hi>Patience had its perfect work;</hi> when his
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:64298:141"/> Sufferings were at the full, his Patience was at the full too; and therefore what an excellent Perſon is Chriſt! and what an excellent Pattern for us! In 1 Pet. 2. 21. the Apoſtle there tell us, that <hi>Chriſt ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered for us, leaving us an example that we ſhould follow his ſteps.</hi> Have we then af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions upon us in any kind? and doth it ſeem good to the Lord to exerciſe us with troubles without or within, or both? Oh, but let us pray that we may be <hi>Patient;</hi> however, that we may not reſiſt the Holy Will of God, by unwillingneſs to ſuffer. And I pray conſider this, That tho in ſome reſpects Chriſt had that to quiet and compoſe his Spirits to Patience in his Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, which we have not; yet in other reſpects we have ſomething to be thought upon for the quieting of our Spirits in our Sufferings, which Chriſt had not. There are two things which Chriſt had to quiet him that we have not; as,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That no ſuffering of any kind came upon him, but what he <hi>foreſaw:</hi> this is a great means to keep perſons patient, to foreſee ſuch or ſuch an Affliction; if they be ſurprized with ſome great Calamity on a ſudden, and had no inkling of it before, but it breaks in upon them like the Sea,
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:64298:142"/> unexpectedly, then many times there is much impatience mingled with that condition, tho it ſhould not be ſo; but now Jeſus Chriſt knew of his troubles particularly before they came, which we do not; we cannot tell what will befall us between this and Death; what Affliction will meet us ſuch a time, in ſuch a place; as <hi>Paul, Acts</hi> 20. 22. Not knowing <hi>the things that ſhall befall me:</hi> he had a <hi>general</hi> notion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it, as <hi>verſ.</hi> 23. but particularly he knew not what would befall him; but it was not ſo with Chriſt. See a place where he ſpeaks of <hi>his</hi> going up to <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> (as <hi>Paul</hi> doth here) and you ſhall find that Chriſt knew what would befall <hi>him,</hi> Matth. 20. 17, 18, 19. <hi>Behold, we go up to Jeruſalem, and the Son of man ſhall be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed unto the chief prieſts, and unto the Scribes, and they ſhall condemn him to death: And ſhall deliver him to the Gentiles, to mock, and to ſcourge, and to crucifie him: and the third day he ſhall riſe again.</hi> Mark how particularly Chriſt foreſaw things; and no doubt but this was one help to Chriſts Patience, he knew it would be thus.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That he had not ſo much as a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of Impatience <hi>within him;</hi> there was
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:64298:142"/> no tendency in <hi>his ſpirit</hi> that way; for that's true in this caſe, which he ſaid of himſelf, Joh. 14. 30. <hi>The prince of this world com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, and hath nothing in me.</hi> But now, the Lord knows 'tis not ſo with us, we have corrupt natures that are breeding of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content, and impatience, and very apt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all occaſions to be breaking out; and we have much to do, the beſt of us; nay, 'tis more than the beſt of us can do with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Grace of God aſſiſting us, to bear any Affliction patiently, we have ſuch ſeeds of ſin within us.</p>
               <p>But, as I ſaid, in ſome reſpects we have that to think of, to quiet us in our Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings which Chriſt had not; as,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That our Afflictions are <hi>but ſmall;</hi> Chriſt could not ſay ſo of his, he could not call them light Afflictions, as <hi>Paul</hi> doth his, and ſuch as befall the people of God. No they were great, exceeding great, both for number and for nature: and what ſhall not we be patient under <hi>ſmall</hi> Afflictions?</p>
               <p n="2">2. That whatever we ſuffer, we have <hi>deſerved it;</hi> this ſhould quiet us. Do we ſuffer? why, have we not ſinned? <hi>Lam.</hi> 3. 39. Yea, but Chriſt ſuffered, and <hi>others</hi>
                  <pb n="264" facs="tcp:64298:143"/> 
                  <hi>deſerved</hi> it; he did not come to the Croſs as the Thieves did that were crucified with him: Mark what the good Thief ſaies, Luk. 23. 40, 41.—<hi>We receive the due re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of our deeds; but this man hath done nothing amiſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. That whatever we ſuffer, if we be the people of God, we don't ſuffer with <hi>a curſe;</hi> we are afflicted, but we are not curſed; ſhould not this quiet us? But there was <hi>a curſe</hi> upon Chriſt while he ſuffered; <hi>He was made a curſe for us,</hi> Gal. 3. 13.</p>
               <p>6. The excellency of this perſon will further appear, if we conſider with what admirable <hi>Humility</hi> he did all in this work. Never was there one ſo high in ſome reſpects, and yet ſo low in others. If he would have ſtood upon't, we muſt needs confeſs that he had ſo much worth, and greatneſs, and goodneſs in him, that the beſt upon Earth were not worthy to wait upon him, or to be in his company. See what <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt, and the good Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turion, ſpeak in this thing,—<hi>Whoſe ſhoes I am not worthy to bear,</hi> ſays the firſt, Matth. 3. 11. <hi>I am not worthy that thou ſhouldſt come under my roof,</hi> ſays the other,
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:64298:143"/> chap. 8. 8. Nay, all the <hi>Angels</hi> of God are commanded to <hi>fall down before him,</hi> Heb. 1. 6. And yet, oh! how did he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſe himſelf, tho he were the Son of God, tho he was the <hi>head of all principalities and power,</hi> tho he <hi>had in all things the prehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minence;</hi> he was too good in ſome ſenſe to appear in ſuch a ſinful World as this is; and if he ſhould have appeared according to his excellency, his Majeſty would have been too bright for the eyes of man to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold him; but when he came to be our Redeemer, he laid his Glory aſide, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther veiled it under a mean and baſe out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward appearance; and he was content for a while to be as it were a Pearl of great price lying upon a Dunghil. I pray will you hearken a little to a few things wherein his great Humility was manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, while he carried on this Freedom of ours; and afterwards I will tell you what you are to do with this famous Example of Chriſts.</p>
               <p n="1">1. He humbled himſelf in becoming <hi>a Man;</hi> you'l quickly ſee what great humiliation here was, if you conſider what he was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: why before he was Man, he was God: (but take heed, do not think that he did
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:64298:144"/> ceaſe to be God when he became Man, but he took the humane Nature to the Divine, and ſo both Natures, tho they were, and are, and ſhall be for ever di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed, were united together in one Perſon.) Hence 'tis ſaid, that <hi>God was manifeſted in the fleſh;</hi> and <hi>the word was made fleſh and dwelt among us.</hi> Now what an abaſement was here! Men and Angels may and will to all eternity admire it, that God ſhould come into the World in the likeneſs of ſinful fleſh! Beloved, if you ſhould ſee a King upon the Throne eſpouſe a beggar, would you not ſay 'twere an Act of great Humiliation in him? why thus the Lord Jeſus humbled himſelf, and much more, in becoming man; for he was the greateſt King that ever was, and our Nature was the verieſt Beggar that ever was. If you would look upon it a little under the conſideration of a Woman, the better to conceive of things; what a wife was here like to be for Chriſt? As pitiful a Creature as ever eye beheld, Poor, Naked, Loathſom, Wicked, Curſed; 'twas a Nature that looked <hi>like the Devil.</hi> I pray don't miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take again; Chriſt did not take the devil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhneſs of our nature; he kept Free from
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:64298:144"/> all the corruptions and pollutions of it; but he came as near to it as poſſible could be without ſin. I know not for my life how to expreſs it better to you than thus, I pray Mark it: He took the <hi>Humanity</hi> of our nature, but not the <hi>Iniquity;</hi> the Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity of it was <hi>imputed</hi> to him, but it was <hi>not united</hi> to him; it was laid <hi>upon him,</hi> but it was not <hi>in him;</hi> for he was <hi>holy, harmleſs, undefiled, ſeparate from ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,</hi> Heb. 7. 26. Now that the Divine nature, and our poor beggarly, loſt, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done nature ſhould thus meet toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the Perſon of Chriſt, that he ſhould take this to himſelf for an everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing companion: Oh! beloved, 'twas an high Advancement for us, but 'twas an unſpeakable Abaſement in Chriſt. If he ſhould have took the nature of <hi>Angels,</hi> it would have been a wonderful Humiliation in him; but that he ſhould take the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of <hi>man,</hi> of <hi>ſinful man;</hi> that he ſhould come down from the Throne of his Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and embrace, and eſpouſe ſuch a beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar as this was, what an excellent perſon muſt Chriſt needs be for Humility? You ſhall find in <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. That this is brought in as a great Evidence of his Humility, (of which he is ſpeaking before, that he
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:64298:145"/> ſhould be one with us, and make us his brethren, and not be aſhamed to call us ſo, <hi>ver.</hi> 11.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In that he did not onely humble himſelf ſo low as to <hi>become a Man,</hi> but that he would be of the <hi>loweſt rank</hi> of men in the World, Phil. 2. 7. <hi>He made himſelf of no reputation, and took upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf the form of a ſervant.</hi> As he went up and down among men, they that knew not who he was, would have thought he had been ſome poor Servant, he had ſuch a baſe outward appearance; ſo that he took away all occaſion for any bodies ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch queſtions as theſe: When they looked upon him, <hi>What gallant Gentleman is that, that goes there? What do you think that brave Suit coſt that he wears?</hi> No, I warrant you ſome asked queſtions that were rather contrary to theſe, <hi>What poor ſorry man that was?</hi> &amp;c. He was not only a Servant to God, for that's an honourable thing; but he was a <hi>Servant to men,</hi> Luke 22. 27. <hi>I am among you as he that ſerveth;</hi> he did the greateſt Service for men that ever was, he delivered them out of the greateſt danger, he ſerved them ſo as to <hi>ſuffer</hi> for them; that's ſuch a notable piece of Service that no man is able to do
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:64298:145"/> one for another. If there could be ſuch a thing as that when any of you are to undergo great pains, another ſhould come and bear them for you; or when you are to dye, another ſhould come and dye for you, and ſo you ſhould not dye at all; or if the Wrath of God were ready to fall upon your Souls, another ſhould come and let all fall upon himſelf; what notable Service would this Perſon do you! Now ſuch a Servant to men was Chriſt; if they believe in him, he excuſes them from their eternal pains, and eternal Death, and from Gods eternal Wrath, by ſuffering it for them. And what a Servant to men did he ſhew himſelf in reference to their very Bodies, that he laboured like any Servant in doing good to them that way, in healing the Sick, in opening the Eyes of the Blind, in caſting out De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils! <hi>He went about every where, doing good, and healing all manner of diſeaſes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the people;</hi> yea, he ſtooped to the meaneſt Offices, Joh. 13. 4, &amp;c. he waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Diſciples feet, which was ſuch a humility in him, that <hi>Peter</hi> told him flat and plain, <hi>he ſhould never do it for him;</hi> and no doubt but he wondered that any of the other Diſciples would offer to let
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:64298:146"/> him do it to them. Chriſt was fain to bring him off from his peremptorineſs with a rowzing word, <hi>If I waſh thee not, thou haſt no part with me,</hi> verſ. 8. (Tho Chriſt had a ſpiritual meaning in it): or elſe he would never have yielded to it, he looked upon it as a thing ſo far below Chriſt; but rather than have <hi>no part with him,</hi> at laſt he did not only ſuffer it, but deſire it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. He ſhewed his humility in his <hi>ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting himſelf to the Ordinances.</hi> Chriſt had no need of them, we muſt wait upon them, becauſe we have ſuch need of them, as much need of them as our Bodies have of Phyſick when they are Sick, and of Food when they are Hungry; but Chriſt he had no ſin in him, nor no grace imperfect, and yet he would come to the Ordinances; he was <hi>Circumciſed</hi> at eight days; and then when the <hi>New-Teſtament</hi> Ordinance of <hi>Baptiſm</hi> was ſet on foot by his forerun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner <hi>John the Baptiſt,</hi> he came and would be <hi>Baptized</hi> himſelf, tho <hi>John</hi> wondered at his humility in it. See <hi>Matth.</hi> 3. 13, 14, 15. and ſo he went into <hi>Synagognes,</hi> as his manner was on the Sabbath-day, <hi>Luk.</hi> 4. 16.</p>
               <pb n="271" facs="tcp:64298:146"/>
               <p n="4">4. In <hi>having no poſſeſſions in the World,</hi> I may ſay concerning Chriſt, in this caſe, as 'tis ſaid God dealt with <hi>Abraham</hi> about the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> Acts 7. 5. <hi>God gave him no inheritance in it, no not ſo much as to ſet his foot on, yet he promiſed that he would give it to him for a poſſeſſion.</hi> So you ſhall ſee God hath promiſed to Chriſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2. 8. that he ſhould have all the World; and yet, when he was in it, he had not ſo much of his own, as to ſet his foot on, after the way of mens having poſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſions; he would not, to ſhew his humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Hence you find him telling the Scribe that ſaid, <hi>he would follow him whither ſoever he went;</hi> that the <hi>Foxes have holes, and the Birds of the Air have neſts; but the Son of man hath not where to lay his head,</hi> Matth. 8. 20. The Lord Jeſus Chriſt did that which many are afraid of; they are afraid of <hi>becoming poor:</hi> what! to have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, to be brought to nothing! but he <hi>became</hi> poor, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 9.</p>
               <p n="5">5. In his <hi>aſſociating himſelf with the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ſort of perſons.</hi> He did not ſeek the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance of the great ones of the World; one of his great acquaintance was <hi>John the Baptiſt,</hi> a man whoſe Raiment was of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mels</hi> hair, and a Leathern Girdle about his
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:64298:147"/> Loins; and others that he was moſt inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate with, they were a company of <hi>Fiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ermen,</hi> and he would eat with <hi>Publicans and Sinners,</hi> and be very familiar with the <hi>poor.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. In his <hi>refuſing the preferments of the World,</hi> when they were offered to him. Sometimes he had a very fair occaſion in his way to make himſelf great upon Earth; but he would not cloſe with it; he could as willingly lay a Crown at his foot, as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers could deſire to have it upon their heads, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6. 15. The truth is, he was made a greater King by his Father alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, than any upon Earth could make him; he had ſet him as <hi>King upon his holy hill of Zion,</hi> Pſal. 2. 6. he had made him King in his Church, and King of Saints; but this was an Inviſible and Spiritual Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; the moſt neither knew or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved that he had a Kingdom which was not of this World.</p>
               <p n="7">7. In his <hi>Subjection to his Parents,</hi> of which you read <hi>Luke</hi> 2. 51. He beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved himſelf in all dutifulneſs towards them, going and coming at their lawful commands, with cheerfulneſs and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; he never gave them any juſt cauſe to find fault with him for any unbecom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:64298:147"/> carriage towards them; he was a Child that carried himſelf better towards his Parents, than his Parents did towards him; they were ſinful Parents, but he was an holy Child, filling up his Relation to them in the fear of God. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you young ones, that have Parents, and carry your ſelves croſly, and ſtubborn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and diſobediently towards them, tho God hath commanded you to <hi>honour your Father and Mother:</hi> Where did you learn to be ſo rebellious? are you too good to be ruled, and ordered by your Parents, when Chriſt thought not himſelf too good to be ſubject to his, and yet one of them was but his Father-in-Law, his <hi>ſuppoſed</hi> Father, as the Scripture calls <hi>Joſeph? Luk.</hi> 3. 23. Now, you are ready to think here that you may take more liberty. If it were your own natural Father or Mother, thoſe that you had been begotten and born of, then you'l ſay perhaps you would not be ſo ſtout; but Chriſt carried him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf as dutiful to him that was but his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-in-Law, as he did to his own Mother that bare him in her Womb; ſuch was his Humility!</p>
               <pb n="274" facs="tcp:64298:148"/>
               <p n="8">8. In his <hi>tender condeſcending to the weakeſt in Grace,</hi> Matth. 12. 20. He had a company of Diſciples about him, that were but like <hi>little Children,</hi> in reſpect of ſpiritual ſtature, and ſo he often calls them; and yet, oh, how ſweetly did he condeſcend to them, by inſtructing them in their ignorance, and compaſſionating of them in their weakneſs, and bearing with them in their Infirmities!</p>
               <p n="9">9. In his <hi>not ſeeking his own commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> for any of the great things which he did or ſuffered, Joh. 5. 41. <hi>I receive not honour from men;</hi> he could ſpeak with the greateſt Wiſdom, and act with the greateſt Power, and live with the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Holineſs, and ſuffer with the greateſt Patience, and yet nothing puffed him up. I cannot enlarge upon theſe things.</p>
               <p>Now that which we are to do with this famous Example of Chriſt, is to <hi>learn from it to be humble,</hi> Matth. 11. 29. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Mercies, whatever Gifts, whatever Graces, the Lord beſtows upon us, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever uſe the Lord makes of us in one kind, or other, ſtill to lye low give all the Glory to God, and take none to our ſelves. It is the great ſin of many, that they cannot know a little more than others know, or do
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:64298:148"/> a little more than others do, or have a little more than others have, but preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they are proud of it; and if no body will commend them, they'l commend themſelves. I beſeech you watch much againſt this ſin; Jeſus Chriſt hath made it the great mark of an Hypocrite, <hi>Matth.</hi> 6. 5. A true Chriſtian ſees ſo many de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects in his beſt works, that he deſires ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be aſhamed of them, than to glory in them.</p>
               <p>7. We may conſider the Excellency of his Perſon, (in Relation to this Freedom), in his doing of what he did in it, with ſo much <hi>deſire.</hi> Beloved, this work did not at all look deſirably in it ſelf; never was there ſuch a black and dreadful face upon any work that ever was undertaken; and yet upon ſome accounts Chriſt <hi>deſired</hi> it, and deſired it ſo much, that I doubt not to ſay, he did rejoyce in his Spirit, to think that he was the Perſon that was to do it. You know that when there is a motion made, for the carrying on of ſome great deſign, that will be of publick and unſpeakable benefit, tho indeed it will coſt a deal to bring it to paſs, and the Perſon that is engaged in it, whoever he
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:64298:149"/> be, muſt be at a vaſt charge before he can finiſh it; why the very motioning of ſuch a thing raiſes our deſire, and we are full of good wiſhes towards it, and all peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple generally will long, Oh, that it might be carryed on! and they'l ſay 'tis a World of pitties that ſuch a noble deſign ſhould not be put forward; but ſuppoſe that the carrying on of it, ſhould be caſt by Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity upon any of our particular perſons; that the King ſhould ſingle out ſuch a man, whom he ſees to be much taken with the motion, and ſhould ſay, Well, I pitch upon you to be engaged in this buſineſs; truly, then our deſire towards the thing would be much damped, if it be our ſelves that muſt do it; and now we it may be, can rather deſire that the buſineſs ſhould be quite laid aſide, than that it ſhould be carried on by us; that 'tis we that muſt bear the burthen of it, and we that muſt be at the charge; how chill and cold will our affections grow to a work then, tho it be never ſo uſeful! but Jeſus Chriſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired that this great and coſtly work of our Redemption ſhould go on, tho the lot fell upon himſelf to do it: You have divers expreſſions in Scripture that ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie thus much; I will quote Four amongſt
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:64298:149"/> many. One is in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53. 11. where what he did in this work, is called the <hi>Travel of his Soul;</hi> which, as I think, I have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly hinted, I look upon as not only ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting out the greatneſs of his Sufferings in it, but alſo the <hi>great deſire</hi> that he had to go through with it. A ſecond is, Luk. 12. 50. <hi>But I have a baptiſm to be baptized with, and how am I ſtraitned till it be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed!</hi> A third is, Joh. 18. 11. ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the bitter Cup of his Sufferings, <hi>ſhall I not drink it?</hi> A fourth is, that in Heb. 10. 9. <hi>Lo, I come to do thy will, O God:</hi> The very words ſound, as if Chriſts de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire were upon the work; and if you compare it with <hi>Pſal.</hi> 40. 7, 8. from whence this is quoted, you ſhall ſee that there is no leſs a word put in there, than <hi>delight,</hi> which muſt needs carry deſire a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long with it; <hi>I delight to do thy will, O my God.</hi> Now, what an excellent perſon muſt this needs be, that could come to ſuch a hard, painful, coſtly work, under the weight of which all the Angels in Heaven would have ſunk into nothing, with ſo much <hi>deſire!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>8. Which will yet further appear, if we conſider, that he ſhould do it with ſo
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:64298:150"/> much <hi>exactneſs</hi> as he did; there are ſome things that when they are done, we uſe to ſay, <hi>they are done after a faſhion,</hi> meaning, that they are ſorrily done; if another had had it in hand, it would have been another kind of thing. But beloved, this ſame Freedom of ours that Chriſt hath been a performing; oh, 'tis excellently done, moſt admirably done, 'tis the exacteſt, curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſeſt piece that ever was wrought, 'tis done to the life; Chriſt hath ſhewn him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in it, a <hi>workman that needeth not to be aſhamed.</hi> I remember 'tis ſaid in <hi>Exod.</hi> 39. 43. That when they into whoſe hearts God had put wiſdom to deviſe cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious works for the Tabernacle, brought all to <hi>Moſes</hi> when they had finiſhed it, <hi>Moſes</hi> looked upon all their work, and beheld that they had done it <hi>as</hi> the Lord commanded; Even <hi>ſo</hi> had they done it, <hi>i. e.</hi> with that exactneſs; and <hi>Moſes bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed</hi> them: ſo we have great cauſe to bleſs Chriſt, when we look upon this exact work of his, and to ſay, <hi>he hath done all things well, very well;</hi> there is not the leaſt thing miſſing in it; every way perfect, his work is like himſelf; Chriſt is a <hi>none-ſuch,</hi> and ſo is his work: View it from the beginning to the end, 'tis all over com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat;
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:64298:150"/> let the Saints look upon it, they'l ſay, the like was never ſeen; let Angels look upon it, and they'l ſay ſo too; let God himſelf look upon it, and he will ſay ſo too, and therefore his work is called the <hi>pleaſure</hi> of the Lord, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53. 10. <hi>i. e.</hi> 'tis ſo done, as that he is well pleaſed with it. From hence we ſhould learn of Chriſt to be no bunglers in our work. Two things there be that Chriſtians ſhould much aim at: 1. To do <hi>what</hi> they ſhould; that God may not ſet us about ſuch and ſuch work, and we be doing that is contrary; when God bids you ſerve him, take heed, don't go, and inſtead of that, ſin againſt him; don't be about the Devils work, when you ſhould be about the Lords; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member you owe him Service, but you owe the Devil none; 'tis a good queſtion to be often asking your ſelves, Whoſe work am I a doing? 2. To do it <hi>as</hi> they ſhould, here the Lord knows we come miſerably ſhort; ſometimes we can ſee, through grace, that what we are about is good for the <hi>matter;</hi> but oh, then for the <hi>manner</hi> of doing it, how we fail in that! Sirs, where is your exactneſs in duty? You <hi>pray,</hi> but where is your <hi>exactneſs</hi> in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er? You <hi>ſing,</hi> but where is your <hi>exactneſs</hi>
                  <pb n="280" facs="tcp:64298:151"/> in ſinging? You <hi>hear,</hi> but where is your <hi>exactneſs</hi> in hearing? How much better might every thing be done, than we do it? Eph. 5. 15. <hi>See then that you walk cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpectly.</hi> It may be rendred thus out of the Greek: Look how <hi>exactly</hi> you walk [<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>]; how you come up to the height and fulneſs of duty. A man may be about that which he ſhould, and yet may be doing of it by halves; here may be a fault, and there may be a fault; tho you cannot work ſo faſt as you ſhould, yet be careful to do what you do, well. If you cannot write a <hi>faſt hand,</hi> yet labour to write a <hi>fair hand.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>9. Chriſts excellency will appear fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in this, That he did it for <hi>ſo many;</hi> that he could lay down a Ranſome that was ſufficient to Free ſo many; why how many, you'l ſay? that place in Joh. 17. 2. will tell you, <hi>to as many as the Father gave him;</hi> and they be not a few, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered by themſelves, tho they are but a ſmall number compared with them that periſh, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 10. Oh, beloved, there be many that will be the better for Chriſt to all eternity. Oh, that we may be ſome of them; that others may not be made rich by him, and we abide poor; that others
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:64298:151"/> may not have Freedom by him, and we remain in Bondage. What a worthy per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon muſt he needs be, that can help, and pardon, and ſanctifie, and ſave more than you or any Arithmetician in the World is able to take the ſum of them! <hi>Rev.</hi> 7. You have Gods redeemed people ſpoken of, and mark, they are look'd upon under a twofold conſideration. Firſt, as among the <hi>Jews,</hi> the people of God under the <hi>Old Teſtament,</hi> and there indeed you have their number brought in <hi>v.</hi> 4. <hi>One hundred forty four Thouſand,</hi> which you are not to take, as if it were exactly no more; but it is to ſhew, that in the days of the <hi>Old-Teſtament</hi> there were not, as indeed it could not be expected, ſo very many ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, becauſe the people of God were then confined to one Nation: But afterwards in <hi>v.</hi> 9. When the Goſpel is ſuppoſed to ſpread among the Gentiles; then their number is ſo great, that it cannot be taken by any man alive. And therefore you that fear God, you ſhall not want good company in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven: upon Earth you may; becauſe, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps the Saints may now live at ſuch a diſtance from you, that you can have but little of their Society. But in Heaven you'l be all together. 'Tis very true; if
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:64298:152"/> there were none but God there, you would do well enough, he will be all in all; and immediate communion with him, will make up a perfect bleſſedneſs, tho you were there with him alone; but you ſhall have God and Angels too, and God and all the Saints too, the whole Hoſt of the redeemed Ones by Chriſt, ſhall meet in one general Aſſembly, and there you ſhall ſee better than now you do, what an excellent Perſon Chriſt is, even upon this Account, that he hath made ſo <hi>many</hi> holy, and ſo many happy, and that he hath freed poor ſinners by thouſands, and thouſands of thouſands.</p>
               <p n="10">10. See the excellency of his Perſon further, In that he did all <hi>alone;</hi> he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged this great work, and bare this heavy burthen without the help or hand of any Creature in Heaven or Earth, Iſa. 63. 3. <hi>I have trodden the wine-preſs alone, and of the people there was none to help me, Heb.</hi> 1. 3. he did all by <hi>himſelf;</hi> the truth is, there was no Creature above or below that could ſtrike one ſtroak in it; the work was of ſuch a nature, that if the beſt of them all had but medled in it, they had ſpoiled it. Angels in Heaven have a great deal of Skill, and Wiſdom, and Power, one of thoſe glorious Spirits can do more
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:64298:152"/> then a whole World of men, but if they had all joyned their skill, and their Power together; their Wiſdom would have proved but fooliſhneſs, and their Power but weakneſs in this matter; 'twas a buſineſs too great for any but the Son of God to be the Saviour of one Soul; but when he comes to it, his <hi>own</hi> arm brought Salvation. And as for any help from man; ſurely, if any body were like to lend him any Aſſiſtance, it muſt have been ſome of the good people that lived in that Generation, when he was in the days of his fleſh; but you know what the Scripture ſaith expreſly about that, that when he was in the very heat and brunt of his work, then <hi>all his Diſciples forſook him and fled,</hi> Matth. 26. 56. That which I would commend to you from hence, is this, That you would let Chriſt be all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone ſtill, I mean in the point of your Juſtification, he was ſo in the work of your Redemption. Now, as none was joyned with him there, ſo joyn nothing with him here: Sirs, whom do you look to for your Acceptance with God? Why you'l ſay to Chriſt, but is it Chriſt alone? Have you ſet him by <hi>himſelf</hi> in this thing? Some there be that hope for mercy from God, but they do not look to Chriſt <hi>at</hi>
                  <pb n="284" facs="tcp:64298:153"/> 
                  <hi>all;</hi> they have this and that of their own, which they hope will do; ſuch honeſt, and ſuch blameleſs, and ſuch righteous per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons as they are, muſt out of all queſtion, be in a good condition: this will prove a Rock to ſplit you on one ſide, to dream of Salvation without Chriſt, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 10. Others there be that look to Chriſt, but not to <hi>Chriſt alone.</hi> Some thing muſt be mingled with him; they'l do ſomething, and Chriſt muſt make up the reſt; this will prove a Rock to ſplit you on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide. I tell you, your Faith will never be counted for righteouſneſs, if you make theſe wretched mixtures in the buſineſs of your Juſtification: 'Tis <hi>to him that worketh not, but believeth in him that juſtifieth the ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that faith is counted for righteouſneſs,</hi> Rom. 4. 5.</p>
               <p n="11">11. Again, In that he did it at <hi>once,</hi> Heb. 10. 10. <hi>Once for all;</hi> when he went about it, he did it, and there was an end of it; he did not come into the World twice for it. He is counted a worthy perſon that can accompliſh a buſineſs of great concernment, tho he makes many a journey to the place where he is to do it; but Chriſt made but one journey from Heaven to Earth, about this work, and he finiſhed it; and therefore he gave up
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:64298:153"/> the Ghoſt, with thoſe words in his mouth, <hi>It is finiſhed:</hi> as if he ſhould ſay, there's nothing left for another time. Learn from hence what great things Chriſt can do in a little while, and wait upon him in the Faith of it. One thing that doth much help to caſt us, and keep us down in our Spirits when we have this and that trouble upon us, is our forgetting how quickly Chriſt can ſpeak to our condition; what a great work was it, when there aroſe ſuch a mighty Tempeſt in the Sea, and the Ship that the Diſciples were in, was covered with Waves, and they were all in danger to ſink pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently, to bring down theſe high Winds, and to lay thoſe hugh Waves! but Chriſt did it in a trice, <hi>Matth.</hi> 8. 24, 25, 26. Poor Chriſtian! haſt thou a great corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to be ſubdued? haſt thou a ſtrong temptation to be removed? haſt thou a great ſtrait to be delivered out of? Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member Chriſt can do it at once; it may be thou haſt been hacking, and hew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at ſuch a ſin, or temptation, a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, and a hundred times, and trying many means, and all wont do: Why but at once Chriſt can do it; look to him bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then thou doſt, if he ſtrike but one ſtroak at a luſt, down 'twill come; but
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:64298:154"/> one ſtroak at a temptation, it is gone.</p>
               <p n="12">12. Laſtly, The excellency of his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon appears in this, That he performed this work of our Freedom, with ſo much <hi>overplus:</hi> According to that Scripture which I have formerly quoted, Rom. 5. 20. <hi>Where ſin abounded, grace did much more abound.</hi> If you ſhould lay our Bondage in one Scale of the Ballance, and this Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom by Chriſt in the other, this will weigh that down to the ground. This Offering of Chriſts for the Salvation of Sinners that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in him, may be alluded to, from that in <hi>Exod.</hi> 36. where you read that the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> offered ſo much towards the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of the Tabernacle, that there was fain to be a Proclamation throughout the Camp, that there was brought in more than enough, and they ſhould now hold their hands, <hi>verſ.</hi> 5, 6, 7. But beloved, Chriſt hath brought in ſuch abundance for our Redemption, that if ever there were need of a Proclamation to ſtop any from doing no more in a good work, 'twas in this caſe; 'tis true that our ſins, and wants, and miſeries, were very great; but this remedy for them, is above them, beyond all expreſſion. I had almoſt ſaid, if it be poſſible for a Soul to be <hi>overſaved,</hi> Chriſt
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:64298:154"/> hath done it. It muſt needs have been a great comfort to believers, when they had thought of this Freedom by Chriſt, if they could but have ſaid this of it, Well, bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed be God, there is <hi>enough;</hi> tho there be nothing over, yet there is nothing want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; we have not a ſin but he can pardon, we have not a want but he can ſupply; he hath as <hi>much</hi> as we can need. Oh! but there is much more comfort than ſo, much more cauſe of rejoycing for them; for they may ſay, that 'tis not poſſible for them to take in what he is able to give out. When the prodigal thought of his Fathers houſe, ſaith he, (Luke 15. 17.) <hi>There's bread enough and to ſpare:</hi> So when you think of Chriſt, you may ſay, There's Freedom <hi>enough,</hi> and to ſpare. And oh, that God would help you poor ſinners, in the thinking of this, to reflect upon your ſelves, as the Prodigal did upon himſelf, when he ſpake thoſe words, that there was in his Fathers houſe <hi>bread enough, and to ſpare;</hi> and <hi>I periſh</hi> with hunger, ſaith he; as if he ſhould ſay, Why then, what do I do here in my undone famiſhed condition? Why don't I go thither? Wretch that I am! is not that a better place for me, than this is? He had, through mercy, ſuch a
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:64298:155"/> ſenſe of his preſent condition, that he could not endure to be in it any longer. I will ariſe and go <hi>to my Father,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>verſ.</hi> 18. and when he came to him, there he found enough, and to ſpare indeed; there was <hi>compaſſion</hi> in the Fathers heart, and <hi>running</hi> towards him when he ſaw him, and falling <hi>upon his neck</hi> and <hi>kiſſing</hi> of him; and calling for the beſt Robe, and for the Ring, and the Shooes, and for the fatted Calf to be killed. So Sirs, if you would come to Chriſt once, you would come to one that hath enough, and to ſpare; there wants but one thing, which indeed was that which brought the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digal home, and the Lord work it in you: And that is, he was grown <hi>ſo hungry</hi> that he thought verily he ſhould have periſhed. Oh, that it were but come to this with you, that are yet afar off, that you had ſuch a kind of hunger after Chriſt; and I would make no doubt but you alſo would quickly ſay, <hi>I will ariſe and go to him.</hi>

               <p>THE Third thing for the making out the excellency of this Freedom, is the conſideration of the <hi>excellent Price</hi> with which it was purchaſed. Now that which I ſhall ſpeak upon this, ſhall be to open two things.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. <hi>That this Freedom was purchaſed:</hi> And,</item>
                  <item>2. <hi>That it was purchaſed with an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent price.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
               <p>1. This Freedom is a <hi>purchaſed</hi> Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. Perſons that are in Bondage, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not come to be Free, but it muſt be by one of theſe ways, Either their Freedom muſt be given them, or it muſt be bought; and if it cannot be bought by thenſelves, then it muſt be by another for them. Now the truth is, we come to have our
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:64298:156"/> Freedom by Chriſt, both theſe ways; By Gift in reſpect of us, but by Purchaſe in reſpect of Chriſt: Or to expreſs it a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle otherwiſe; It is given to us upon the account or conſideration that it was pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed by Chriſt for us, and ſo it muſt be purchaſed by Chriſt, that it might be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to us, See Rom. 3. 24. <hi>Being juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied freely by his Grace, through the Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that is in Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Mark, it comes to us <hi>freely</hi> and <hi>by grace,</hi> that is, as a meer Gift, which we could neither buy nor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve; but yet 'tis <hi>through the Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that is in Chriſt,</hi> that is, he purchaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it for us: and therefore <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 14. all the company that do truly belong to Chriſt, are called the <hi>purchaſed Poſſeſſion;</hi> for ſo the beſt Expoſitors do under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand theſe words, as nor meant of <hi>Heaven,</hi> or bleſſed Immortality, but of the <hi>Church of Chriſt;</hi> not of the place of Glory, to which they ſhall come; but of the people that ſhall come to the place; they are a <hi>purchaſed Poſſeſſion;</hi> ſo particularly <hi>Calvin</hi> upon the place. And ſo 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 20. when the Apoſtle is ſtirring of them up to glorify God in their body, and in their ſpirit, he makes uſe of this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, That they were <hi>bought with a</hi>

                  <hi>Price;</hi> and this is the meaning of all thoſe places of Scripture, in which believers are called <hi>Servants</hi> of God, and <hi>Servants</hi> of Chriſt; particularly, ſee that place <hi>Joh.</hi> 12. 26. When you meet with this word (as you may often), you muſt underſtand of what kind of Servants this is meant; and for this you muſt know, that there were (among other diviſions that might be made of them) two ſorts of Servants: Either <hi>hired</hi> Servants, that agreed to dwell with ſuch a Maſter for ſuch Wages, and for ſuch a time, and then were gone again, and and at their own diſpoſe: Others there were, that were <hi>bought</hi> Servants, bought with money, as <hi>Abraham</hi> had many of them in his houſe. Now theſe kind of Servants were much more under the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and at the pleaſure of their Maſters, than thoſe who were but hired; they might uſe a far greater Soveraignty over them. Now I ſay, when you read that believers are called the Servants of Chriſt, you muſt underſtand it in this latter Senſe, that they are his <hi>bought</hi> Servants (for Chriſt doth not care for hirelings), and ſo he hath a full and abſolute right to them, as a man hath to any thing which he hath bought with his money. Now here
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:64298:157"/> I would a little Anſwer to three Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, about this purchaſed Freedom, which may profitably be raiſed.</p>
               <p>Queſt. 1. <hi>How can this Freedom be ſaid to be purchaſed?</hi> For it may be many of us cannot tell how to conceive that there ſhould be ſuch kind of things done here, as uſe to be in the making of a purchaſe. The Anſwer may be twofold.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Beloved, whatever darkneſs there is in our underſtanding of things, yet to be ſure the language of the Scripture is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry proper and ſuitable; and the fault is not in the Scriptures expreſſion, but in our conception, that's weak, and ſhort, and dull. <hi>Nicodemus</hi> could not conceive aright of what Chriſt ſaid about being born again; he was ready to think that Chriſt did ſpeak nonſenſe, <hi>how can theſe things be?</hi> ſaith he; and yet Chriſt ſpake moſt properly and ſuitably; and 'twas <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>codemus</hi> was the fool in the things of God. So now this is the Scripture Expreſſion, that this Freedom is the <hi>purchaſe</hi> of Chriſt, whether we can underſtand it or no. And how many other things doth the Scripture ſpeak of, which it may be we can under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:64298:157"/> no more than we do this, and yet are very clear in themſelves, tho not to us? I'll only ſay this, The leſs we can underſtand the things of God, the more cauſe we have to be humbled for our Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, and to cry to God, ſo to teach us, that we may be in the number of thoſe to whom 'tis given to know the Myſteries of the Kingdom of God. But,</p>
               <p n="2">2. Yet why may we not very fitly, and ſomewhat more eaſily conceive of this Freedom under the notion of a <hi>purchaſe;</hi> if we ſhould but ſpeak of it according to the cuſtom that is amongſt men? How doth it uſe to be amongſt men in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of purchaſe? conſider that; and you ſhall find there was the like here, tho in a more glorious manner. Now for this, I will turn you to one Scripture, where you ſhall read there was a purchaſe made, and then ſee how things will agree. The place is in <hi>Jer.</hi> 32. 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. In this purchaſe there are divers things.</p>
               <p>1. There was ſomething to be purchaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, i. e. <hi>the Field that was in Anothoth, in the countrey of Benjamin.</hi> 2. The per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſelling it, and that was <hi>Hanameel, Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remiahs <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncles Son.</hi> 3. The perſon buy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:64298:158"/> it, was <hi>Jeremiah: And I bought the Field,</hi> &amp;c. 4. Here was theſe two per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons being together and treating about this buſineſs, v. 8. <hi>Hanameel mine <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncles Son came to me,—and ſaid unto me, buy my Field,</hi> &amp;c. 5. Here's a ſufficient ſolid Reaſon, why <hi>Jeremiah</hi> ſhould be the man that ſhould buy it; <hi>for the right of inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance is thine, and the redemption is thine,</hi> i. e. becauſe he was the next Kinſman. 6. Here is the Price at which it was to be ſold, and that was <hi>ſeventeen ſhekels of ſilver,</hi> and this was paid down, he <hi>weighed</hi> him the money, <hi>v.</hi> 9. 7. Here was the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting drawn, or the Evidence, or Convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance for this, and <hi>Jeremiah</hi> Subſcribes and Seals to it. And then 8. There were Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes to it, <hi>v.</hi> 10. and ſo he takes it to himſelf and diſpoſes of it as he pleaſes, it being now his own. Now if we ſhould go over theſe things again, and ſee how it was in the buſineſs we have in hand, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly we may well ſay, that this was a <hi>purchaſe;</hi> for here was ſomething alſo to be <hi>purchaſed,</hi> and that was <hi>Freedom</hi> for poor ſinners that were in Bondage; then here is the <hi>Perſon</hi> that was to <hi>ſell</hi> this, and that is <hi>God</hi> the Father; then here's the <hi>Perſon buying</hi> this Freedom, and that
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:64298:158"/> is Chriſt the Son: then here's theſe two <hi>Perſons</hi> being together and <hi>treating</hi> about this buſineſs; ſo they did in Heaven: then the like Reaſon holds why Chriſt ſhould be he that ſhould buy this Freedom for us, he was (to be) our near Kinſman, and ſo the right of Inheritance would be his. And then for the <hi>Price</hi> at which it was to be ſold, which was paid down by Chriſt in full weight; we ſhall come to that in its place. And then for the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyance</hi> or Evidence for this, one of which in <hi>Jeremiah</hi>'s caſe was ſealed, and the other open (as the manner then was among the <hi>Jews,</hi> to have two writings, one ſealed up, that they kept to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; and the other open, that any body might read it); why there was the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant between God and Chriſt alone; that's the <hi>ſealed</hi> Evidence; and then there was to be the Book of the Scriptures, wherein this Covenant of Grace is unfolded; this is the <hi>open</hi> Evidence that all may look in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to: And then Chriſt ſubſcribed, as it were, and ſealed to this Covenant or Convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, by giving his full conſent to all that was in it, and binding himſelf by Promiſe to his Father, to perform what he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took in it. And then as for <hi>Witneſſes,</hi>
                  <pb n="296" facs="tcp:64298:159"/> the truth is, there was no creature by when this was done; for 'twas done before the World began: But, beloved, they were Witneſſes to one another; and as we uſe to ſay, <hi>God is more than a Thouſand Witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.</hi> And 'tis enough to tell you, that the faithfulneſs of theſe perſons is ſuch, that their agreement together muſt needs ſtand; See <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. 2. So I have done with that <hi>1ſt Queſtion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Queſt. 2. <hi>But why did it not pleaſe God, that this Freedom ſhould he given to us, and there an end? Why muſt it firſt he purchaſed by Chriſt? Why did God carry it thus here by poor ſinners in bondage, they ſhall be ſet free, if you will pay the price?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Two things to this: 1. In thoſe things which God doth, it were a ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Reaſon (if we knew none other) to ſay, that God would have it ſo. So was his will and pleaſure: And if no other Reaſon could be given, we were to reſt ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied, and ro be ſilenced with this, as the higheſt Reaſon of all. This Reaſon you ſhall find is given for things that are above our reach; as namely, why ſome ſhould be elected, and others paſt by, <hi>Eph.</hi>
                  <pb n="297" facs="tcp:64298:159"/> 1. 5. and why the great things of God and the Goſpel ſhould be revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to poor ſimple creatures, and hid ftom the wiſe and prudent, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11. 25, 26. and why ſuch and ſuch ſhould be ſaved, and others left in their damnable condition, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 18. Now beloved, if we had nothing elſe to ſay, to be ſure we may ſay this, It was the will of God, that Chriſt ſhould purchaſe this Freedom; that you have expreſly in <hi>Joh.</hi> 10. 17, 18. And therefore Chriſt knowing that it was the will of his Father; to be ſure, being ſuch an obedient Son as he was, he would do it: He would by no means have his will to lye croſs to his Fathers will. But,</p>
               <p>2. There is another great Reaſon for it; and we have more to ſay in this caſe than ſo; and that is this, That God was ſo to carry on this buſineſs of our Freedom, as not only to have reſpect to our Good, but alſo and chiefly to his own Glory. While he was to ſee the one ſecured, he muſt ſee that the other did not ſuffer. Now you muſt know, that God could not have <hi>all his</hi> Glory, but in this way. There were Two great Attributes amongſt all the reſt, which God did intend to glorifie, and that is his Mercy and his Juſtice. His Mercy
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:64298:160"/> would have been pleaſed well enough, if ſinners had been ſet free without the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſing of their Freedom. But then his Juſtice would have been offended ſtill: How ſhould that have been quieted and ſatisfied? Therefore this muſt be ſo done, as that <hi>mercy and truth might meet together, and that righteouſneſs and peace might kiſs one another.</hi> Juſtice would have made a loud cry, that Heaven would have rung of it again, if all ſhould have been ſwallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up in mercy, and in giving away all, without any conſideration had to it. For Law and Juſtice could ſay, We have a curſe againſt theſe ſinners; and they are as legal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly condemned, as ever were any Traitors: And therefore pray let us be heard; for they ſhall not, nor cannot go free, if the Debt be not paid. And therefore if they be not able to redeem themſelves, where's the Surety that muſt do it for them, that we may come upon him for all? This now makes it neceſſary that Chriſt muſt <hi>pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe</hi> this Freedom, <hi>Acts</hi> 17. 3.—He <hi>muſt needs</hi> have ſuffered. Why <hi>needs?</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe here was Juſtice to be glorified as well as Mercy.</p>
               <pb n="299" facs="tcp:64298:160"/>
               <p>Queſt. 3. <hi>But if we are thus purchaſed by Chriſt,</hi> may believers ſay, <hi>Then it may ſeem that God the Father, hath quitted his intereſt in us (for ſo 'tis in the manner of purchaſing amongſt men; he that ſells to the purchaſer, quits all his right and title to that which is bought), and we are very ſorry for that: we would be Chriſts, but we would be the Fathers too?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> And ſo you are for all this; See <hi>John</hi> 17. and compare <hi>ver.</hi> 6. and 10. to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. In <hi>ver.</hi> 6. ſaith Chriſt, <hi>Thine they were, and thou gaveſt them me:</hi> This looks now, as if the Father had quitted all his intereſt in them. But 'tis not ſo; for in <hi>ver.</hi> 10. <hi>and all mine are thine.</hi> Still they are <hi>thine,</hi> and thine are mine too, ſaith he: As if he ſhould ſay, We have a mutual in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in them; their being mine, doth not hinder them from being thine, as well as their being thine doth not hinder them from being mine. God had an intereſt in you upon the account of Creation, and that he keeps ſtill; and which is more, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the account of Election, or of everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting love to you, and that he keeps ſtill: and Chriſt he hath a right to you upon the account of Redemption: And tho that
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:64298:161"/> doth enter you into a new relation to him, yet it doth not break off your former rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to God the Father. He loves you, and delights in you as much as ever he did; and your happineſs by Chriſts buying of you, is no way diminiſhed, but increaſed. For both have an intereſt in you, and both love you, <hi>John</hi> 14. 21.</p>
               <p>Now for the <hi>Second</hi> thing, <hi>That this Freedom was purchaſed with an excellent price.</hi> Here I ſhall do Two things: 1. I ſhall labour to make the truth of this ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to you, That 'twas an excellent, moſt excellent price that Chriſt paid for it. 2. I ſhall draw ſome profitable Conſiderations from it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> For the truth of it: Beloved! Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt <hi>paidwell</hi> for this Freedom. God did not deal with Chriſt in this caſe, as you read <hi>Ephron</hi> the <hi>Hittite</hi> would have dealt with <hi>Abraham,</hi> if he would have let him, when he would purchaſe his Field, and the Cave that was in it, for a Burying-place, <hi>Gen.</hi> 23. he would have given it him, <hi>ver.</hi> 11. He tells him indeed the Land was ſo much worth, Four hundred Shekels of Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, if it ſhould be ſold to the full value of it; <hi>but,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>what is that botwixt</hi>
                  <pb n="301" facs="tcp:64298:161"/> 
                  <hi>me and thee? bury therefore thy dead, ver.</hi> 15. And thus he would even have forced it upon him for nothing: But <hi>Abraham</hi> notwithſtanding he ſtood upon it, that if he had it, he would lay down as much mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney as it was worth, <hi>ver.</hi> 9. and ſo he did in <hi>ver.</hi> 16. Nor did the Father ſay to Chriſt, as <hi>Ornan</hi> the <hi>Jebuſite</hi> did to <hi>David,</hi> when he would purchaſe the place of his Threſhing-floor, that he might there build an Altar to the Lord, that the Plague might be ſtayed: <hi>Take it to thee, ſays he, I give thee all,</hi> 1 Chron. 21. 22, 23. tho <hi>David</hi> would not accept of it. So <hi>ver.</hi> 24. <hi>Nay, verily I will buy it for the full price.</hi> So he did, <hi>ver.</hi> 25. But God ſtood upon his price, his full price with Jeſus Chriſt. He held him up, without any abatement of what this Freedom was worth. He paid to the worth of it. 'Tis true, 'tis a wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy precious Freedom; but yet I may ſafely ſay, Chriſt gave enough and enough for it. Oh the price that he paid for it! He did not buy of his Father as we may buy of <hi>him, without price, Iſa.</hi> 55. 1. but he came, as I may ſay, to a <hi>dear Market,</hi> when he came to make his purchaſe.</p>
               <pb n="302" facs="tcp:64298:162"/>
               <p>Queſt. <hi>Well, then you will ſay, pray what was the Price which Chriſt paid for this Freedom?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> Here I ſhall ſpeak that which may make you wonder, and that is this: Tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beloved, he did not pay <hi>one farthing</hi> for it; there did not go a <hi>penny</hi> out of his Purſe. Now it may be that which will be next in you thoughts, will be this; truly then 'twas even cheap enough of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; here's a <hi>Price indeed,</hi> we expected that you would have named ſome vaſt ſum of Silver and Gold, that would have been ſo great as to have beggar'd any man in the World to give it. No, I have not one ſuch word to ſpeak to you; but this I have to ſpeak to you about it, that Chriſt had been as good to have brought a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of <hi>Pebbleſtones</hi> to his Father for this Freedom, as all the Gold and Silver in the World, and one would have done as much as the other; but he and his Son muſt drive another manner of trade than this, to make poor ſinners Free; there muſt be anothergheſs Price; Why what was it? Oh that which was infinitely beyond all the treaſures of this World. If <hi>theſe</hi> would have ſerved, Chriſt by his power could have rained them down from Heaven for a
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:64298:162"/> thouſand years together. But beloved, there muſt be (as I may ſo expreſs it) a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother rain; it muſt <hi>rain Blood,</hi> and Blood from the <hi>ſide and heart</hi> of Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>i. e.</hi> he muſt come down from Heaven, and ſhed his Blood to make a Ranſome for us, ſee Acts 20. 28. <hi>Feed the Church of God, which he hath purchaſed with his own blood;</hi> there's the <hi>Price</hi> that he paid. Now mark a little, while I ſhew you in a few things, that this was a <hi>Price indeed,</hi> an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Price. The Blood of Chriſt to be ſure is precious, as you find it called in 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 19. For this weigh but theſe four things well, and you'l ſay 'tis <hi>precious Blood.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. This Blood of Chriſt is the <hi>great Seal of the Covenant of Grace;</hi> 'tis called the <hi>Blood of the everlaſting Covenant,</hi> Heb. 13. 20. Now in the Covenant of Grace, God promiſed a <hi>World of mercies,</hi> yea, no leſs than an <hi>eternal World of mercies</hi> to his people; and the ſum of this Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant is this, <hi>I will be their God, and they ſhall be my people:</hi> But this he branches out into many exceeding great and preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Promiſes, wherein he ſaies he will do thus and thus, and all that is needful for his people. Take all the Promiſes of
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:64298:163"/> the Goſpel together, and there you have the whole Covenant of Grace unfolded and explained; and oh, what a glorious Covenant 'tis! how much doth, even <hi>one</hi> of the Promiſes of this Covenant carry in it! ſo that we may ſay, Bleſſed, and for ever bleſſed are all they, who are partakers of them, that are the heirs of all thoſe great things that are contained in them; they have Portion enough that have part in the Promiſes. But beloved, all this Covenant, and all the Promiſes of it, would be as nothing, were it not for this Blood of Chriſt, by which God Seals all to believers; 'tis true, indeed, that the Sacraments of the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> are now the Signs and Seals of this Covenant of Grace; but theſe are but Seals of a ſecond nature, outwardly and Viſibly; but that which is repreſented, and ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by the Water in <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> and by the Wine in the <hi>Lords Supper,</hi> is the <hi>Blood</hi> of Chriſt; this is the firſt and great Seal. And therefore 'tis ſaid, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 20. that all the Promiſes of God <hi>in him are yea, and in him Amen.</hi> You know when there is a Covenant or Conveyance made, a man makes great account of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyance; but why? Becauſe it hath
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:64298:163"/> the Seal to it, for 'tis that which makes it to be all of force; if the Seal were gone, what were all elſe worth? Now when Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt came to redeem his people, he was fain, as I may ſo expreſs it, to <hi>pawn his great Seal</hi> for us; that which ratifies and confirms all that ever God hath ſaid he will do for them that fear him.</p>
               <p n="2">2. You will ſee the excellency of this Blood of Chriſt in this too, That no Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice or Duty that ever was performed ſince the fall of man, or ſhall be to the end of the World, ever was, or ever will be accepted at the hands of God, but upon the account of this Blood. I ſay, ſince the <hi>fall,</hi> becauſe before that, God dealt with <hi>Adam</hi> upon another ſcore; he was to be accepted in the way of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect obedience to the Law; but ſince that, if ever God did accept of one Service, or one Sacrifice, or of one Duty, it was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways, and altogether for the ſake of this Blood: What was the Blood of all the Beaſts that were offered in Sacrifice, tho in never ſo great abundance? as you read there, in 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 8. 63. There were <hi>two and twenty thouſand Oxen, and an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and twenty thouſand Sheep,</hi> offered at one time; yet I ſay, what was all this to
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:64298:164"/> God, had it not been for this Blood of Chriſt? And ſo what's all that we do, or can do in any Service, if we don't look to this Blood in the Performance of it? and if God doth not look upon us, and our beſt works in this blood, 'tis but Abomination to him. That's a notable place in Heb. 10. 19, 20, 21, 22. <hi>Having therefore, brethren, boldneſs to enter into the holieſt by the blood of Jeſus,</hi> &amp;c. Ver. 22. <hi>Let us draw near with a true heart, in full aſſurance of faith,</hi> i. e. let us come and preſent our Perſons, and our Services before the Lord, and that with <hi>boldneſs,</hi> noting that there is acceptance for us: But how? <hi>by the Blood of Jeſus;</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out that all would be nothing. Now what a precious thing muſt this Blood of Chriſt be, that puts value to all the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices of the Saints throughout the World? And therefore take heed how you go to any Duty, without looking at it; and pray that God would not look upon any Duty of yours, without ſprinkling this Blood upon it. And by the way, what a caſe are you in, that reſt in your Duties, and don't look to Chriſt in them, but think 'tis well enough if you do but take a Bible and read, or down upon your
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:64298:164"/> knees and pray, and a hundred ſuch things<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but you have no Faith in the Blood of Chriſt in what you do; you may think you have done ſome great mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter now: and oh, this muſt needs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> be accepted; whereas God never did, nor e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver will accept of any mans perſon or work, but upon the account of this Blood. I pray mind that Scripture well, there is much in it to this purpoſe, Rev. 8. 3, 4. <hi>And another Angel came and ſtood at the Altar, having a golden Cenſer, and there was given unto him much Incenſe, that he ſhould offer it with the prayers of all Saints upon the golden Altar, which was before the throne. And the ſmoke of the Incenſe which came with the prayers of the Saints, aſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up before God out of the Angels hand.</hi> Mark ſome things. 1. This <hi>Angel</hi> is Chriſt. 2. His ſtanding at the Altar, is his being, as it were, ready for us, whenever we go to Duty; for on the Altar, under the Law, were the Sacrifices offered. 3. He hath a golden Cenſer in which there was much Incenſe, which is his own righteouſneſs. 4. And with <hi>this he</hi> offers their prayers; he perfumes their Duties with his own ſpiritual Incenſe. 5. They are not the prayers barely of <hi>men,</hi> but of <hi>Saints:</hi>
                  <pb n="308" facs="tcp:64298:165"/> Gods own Children, whoſe prayers are more pure and heavenly then others are<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> even <hi>their</hi> Duties muſt have this perfume. 6. Nor of <hi>ſome</hi> Saints, but <hi>all.</hi> 7. And then that which makes them <hi>aſcend</hi> before God, that is, be accepted of him, is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the ſmoke of <hi>this Incenſe</hi> went up with them: without that they would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be a ſweet ſavour unto God.</p>
               <p n="3">3. This Blood of Chriſt is ſuch a preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous thing, that it makes God <hi>amends for ſin.</hi> If we did but know what unſpeaka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble wrong ſin doth to God, and what un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable diſhonour God hath by it, we ſhould even be ready to ask this queſtion, How is it ever poſſible to make his bleſſed Majeſty the leaſt ſhadow of amends for it? Beloved, if you wrong or trepaſs your Neighbour, you can put that to an Arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and make him amends for it; but who is there of you, that can make God a recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence for the ſins which you have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited againſt him; yea, for the leaſt tranſgreſſion? ſee <hi>Mic.</hi> 6. 6, 7. All your Tears and Blood can never quench that fire of Gods Wrath which is kindled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2. 25. When you have ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken but one idle word, or thought but one vain thought; if you have no more help
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:64298:165"/> to get off the Curſe and Condemnation that is due to it, than Men and Angels can afford you with all their utmoſt ability, you are undone for ever; it makes ſuch a breach between God and you, as the whole Creation cannot make up: But now there is <hi>one</hi> thing, and but <hi>one,</hi> that can make God amends, and full amends for ſin, yea, for <hi>all manner</hi> of ſins, and for never ſo many, and never ſo great ſins, and that is this Blood of Chriſt, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 7. and 2. 1, 2. Tho thou haſt been never ſo vile, and ungodly; yet if thou can'ſt but get this Blood ſprinkled upon thee, through Faith in it, it will make God himſelf to ſay, <hi>deliver him, for I have found a Ranſom;</hi> this will make amends for thy Swearing, and for thy Drunkenneſs, and for thy Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſs, and for all the wicked Abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of thy heart and life: Oh what a precious Blood is this then! And take but one thing more for it, which is,</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>The dreadful Vengeance</hi> which God doth take upon men, wherever the Guilt of this Blood of Chriſt lies. If he doth but come once to avenge the blood of a <hi>man,</hi> he doth <hi>that</hi> ſeverely; if any one hath committed wilful murder upon his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:64298:166"/> God is reſoved that that man ſhall <hi>be ſurely put to death</hi> for it, Numb. 34. 31. but when he comes to take vengeance for the Blood of his Son, here the Vengeance is dreadful beyond all others: You have di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Inſtances that I might give you of it in Scripture. How terribly did God deal with <hi>Judas</hi> for the betraying of this innocent Blood? he filled him with that horror of conſcience, that he muſt be his own Executioner, <hi>Matth.</hi> 27. 5. and in the <hi>hanging of himſelf, he fell headlong, and burſt aſunder in the midſt, and all his bowels guſhed out,</hi> Acts 1. 18. And after all this, he ſent him to his <hi>own place,</hi> and that was a ſad one, <hi>verſ.</hi> 25. So the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the <hi>Jews</hi> that brought upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves the Guilt of Chriſts Blood, <hi>Matth.</hi> 27. 25. they have been under the Curſe of God for this, theſe Sixteen hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years. And ſuch as are <hi>guilty of the Body and Blood of the Lord,</hi> by eating and drinking unworthily in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; you ſee what Vengeance God ſaith he will take of them, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 27, 29. And if any Profeſſor ſhall prophane this Blood by <hi>ſinning wilfully, after he hath received the knowledg of the truth;</hi> you may ſee what a dreadful doom God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounceth
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:64298:166"/> againſt him, in <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. <hi>v.</hi> 26. <hi>There remains no more ſacrifice for ſins, but a certain fearful looking for of judgment,</hi> &amp;c. to the end of <hi>v.</hi> 31. Well now, beloved, this blood which is the <hi>great ſeal of the Covenant of Grace,</hi> and without which no ſervice or duty ever was, or ever ſhall be accepted from the hands of any man, and which is the <hi>blood of Atonement</hi> for all manner of ſins; and the guilt of which God will ſo <hi>dreadfully avenge</hi> wherever it ſhall be found to lye; I ſay, this blood was the price where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the Lord Jeſus Chriſt purchaſed this Freedom: And therefore, your ſelves being Judges, Was it not an excellent price; and hereupon, is not this Freedom an excellent Freedom, ſince Chriſt may well ſay of it, as the chief Captain did to <hi>Paul,</hi> Acts 22. 28. <hi>With a great ſum attained I this freedom?</hi> Now I will end this with but Two Conſiderations briefly.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Conſider from hence this, for your inſtruction, you that are Believers: Be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten thinking, <hi>What ſhall I do for this Chriſt that hath done ſo much for me? Obj.</hi> But it may be you'l ſay, What, doth Jeſus Chriſt look for a requital? Alas! then we are undone on t'other ſide. I anſwer, No: Whatever you do for Chriſt, you muſt be
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:64298:167"/> ſure you do nothing upon the account of requiting of him; as who ſhould ſay, you are greatly in his debt, and you'l do what you can to come out of it. 'Tis not a recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence that I call upon you for (you are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver able to do that); but the manifeſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of your gratitude to him, by an obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ential fruitfulneſs. Do but live as thoſe that are his, and that's all he deſires. Why now, ſhall he that hath paid this great price for you, require any duty at your hands, and will you not do it? or call you to any difficulty for his ſake, and will you ſtick at it? Remember Chriſt obſerves how you walk after ſuch great things as he hath done for you, and don't give him cauſe to ſay to you by your unfaithfulneſs to him, as <hi>Abſalom</hi> ſaid to <hi>Huſhai</hi> concerning <hi>David, Is this thy kindneſs to thy friend? Why went<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt thou not with thy friend?</hi> 2 Sam. 16. 17. Oh! keep with your friend.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Conſider this from hence, for your conſolation: This Jeſus Chriſt who hath <hi>bought</hi> you, will never <hi>ſell</hi> you. You know men many times after they have bought a Purchaſe, and made it their own, they ſell it again. Something or other is in it that they do not like, and ſo they'l part with it. But I am ſure, and be you ſure, that
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:64298:167"/> Chriſt will never deal thus with you. <hi>Obj.</hi> But you'l ſay, We have ſuch great ſins, that we fear he will. <hi>Anſ.</hi> Yea, but you know, that after a Man hath married a Wife (unleſs ſhe offend him ſo by Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, as utterly to break the bond of Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock, which Chriſt will never ſuffer true Believers to do), tho ſhe hath a great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny faults, yet he reſolves he won't put her away. The Law of the <hi>Land</hi> won't let him; nor, which is more, the Law of his <hi>Love</hi> won't let him. He thinks, when he looks upon her, with all her failings, Ay, but ſhe is <hi>mine;</hi> I have made her <hi>mine</hi> tho. So is it here. See 1 Sam. 12. 20, 22. <hi>And Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel ſaid unto the people, Fear not: ye have done all all this wickedneſs, yet turn not aſide from following the Lord, but ſerve the Lord with all your heart: For the Lord will not forſake his people for his great name ſake: becauſe it hath pleaſed the Lord to make you his people.</hi>

                  <hi>Concerning the excellent properties belonging to this Freedom.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>AND now in the Fourth place, I am to demonſtrate, that this is an excellent Freedom, by the excellent <hi>Properties</hi> belonging to it. That you may plainly underſtand what I mean by theſe <hi>Properties,</hi> it is as much as this, That I am now to ſpeak that of this Freedom, which is peculiar or proper to it ſelf, and that cannot be ſaid of any other Freedom. Tho you read of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Freedoms in the Scripture (as that of the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and afterwards out of <hi>Babylon),</hi> which indeed were very great and glorious deliverances, yet they will not reach to this. Never was there the like to this. As the Book of <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles</hi> is called the <hi>Song of Songs,</hi> for the excellency of it; ſo I may call this Fredom, the <hi>Freedom of Freedoms,</hi> becauſe there is none to be compared with it. And therefore this may be the
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:64298:168"/> 
                  <hi>1ſt Property,</hi> That you may take of it: That it is an <hi>incomparable</hi> Freedom: It hath not any fellow, nor any match. That which was done in this Freedom, ws never done in any before, nor never ſhall be in any for the time to come. What is ſaid there, in <hi>Joel</hi> 1. 2, 3. of a great Judgment which the Lord threatens, I may ſay of this great Redemption; <hi>Hear this, ye old men,—Hath this been in your days, or even in the days of your fathers?</hi> &amp;c. And what God ſpeaks to the Children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> about their Freedom out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> I may well apply to this Freedom, <hi>Deut.</hi> 4. 32. <hi>For ask now of the days that are paſt, which were before thee, ſince the day that God created man upon earth; and ask from the one ſide of heaven unto the other, whether there hath been any ſuch thing as this great thing is, or hath been heard like it?</hi> Conſider Three things here, and you will ſee that this is an <hi>incomparable</hi> Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The other <hi>greateſt deliverances that</hi> you read of, which God gave to his people, they <hi>were but the types and ſhadows,</hi> and fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runners <hi>of this</hi> Freedom. Particularly, ſee it in that deliverance out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> you that are acquainted with the ſtory of it,
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:64298:169"/> know what a great deliverance that was. 'Tis ſeldom ſpoken of in the Scripture, but there is a glance upon the greatneſs, and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſneſs of it. 'Twas ſo great, that they were charged never to forget it, <hi>Deut.</hi> 8. 14. And to that end the Lord appointed that they ſhould begin their reckoning of the Months of the Year, with that Month in which this deliverance came, <hi>Exod</hi> 12. 1, 2. And on the <hi>4th</hi> day of that Month, in the Evening of it, which was the very day on which the Lord brought them out of their Bondage, they were to keep the <hi>Paſsover</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very year throughout their Generations, for a Memorial of it, <hi>ver.</hi> 6. 14. compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. And it was ſuch a great deliverance, that <hi>Moſes,</hi> and all the children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> ſung together unto the Lord, in ſolemn praiſes and thankſgivings for it, admiring the riches of his mercy towards them in it; as you may ſee in <hi>Exod.</hi> 15. 1, &amp;c. And it was ſo great, that it put the wicked Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Earth into a trembling to hear of it, <hi>ver.</hi> 14, 15, 16. And again, it was ſo great a deliverance, that the Lord made uſe of it, as the great and ſtrong tie to bind them to himſelf in the ſtricteſt obedience: And therefore when he gave them the Ten Commandments, he ſet this engaging Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:64298:169"/> before them; <hi>I am the Lord thy God, which brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the houſe of bondage:</hi> And then he gives them the <hi>Moral Law;</hi> and in them to us, by whom the aforeſaid Preface is now to be underſtood ſpiritually of his bringing us out of the <hi>ſpiritual Egypt,</hi> and the <hi>ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual</hi> Bondage: And therefore we are to be obedient unto him. But now beloved, tho this deliverance was ſuch a great and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous work, as you muſt needs ſay it was, to bring a matter of Six hundred thouſand Men, beſides Women and Children, with all their Herds and Flocks, out of the Iron Furnace in <hi>Egypt,</hi> where they had been ſtrangers and ſlaves for Four hundred and Thirty years together, and that with ſuch a <hi>mighty hand, and ſtretched-out arm,</hi> as brought deſtruction to their enemies, and redemption to his choſen people: yet, I ſay, this was but a type of this Freedom by Chriſt: This, and all elſe that <hi>Moſes</hi> did, as Gods inſtrument among them, was but to hold forth better things that were after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to be done by Chriſt; See <hi>Heb.</hi> 3. 5. The like might be ſaid of their deliverance out of their Seventy years Captivity in <hi>Babylon;</hi> but I would only inſtance further in one great Freedom that was among the
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:64298:170"/> 
                  <hi>Jews</hi> by the appointment of God himſelf, and that was, That every <hi>50th</hi> year, which was called the year of <hi>Jubilee</hi> (of which you read <hi>Levit.</hi> 25.) there was to be a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Releaſe, and Liberty was to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed throughout all the Land: ſo that they who had ſold, or mortgaged their land or poſſeſſions, were then every one to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to them again, and every <hi>Hebrew</hi> Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant was then to have his Freedom. So that this year was a great and a famous year amongſt them; and 'twas welcomed with a great deal of joy, inſomuch that it was called by them, the <hi>Acceptable year;</hi> Why this alſo was to point out this Freedom by Chriſt; you ſhall find it alluded to in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 61. 1, 2. where the ſame expreſſions are uſed by Chriſt in his ſetting forth his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, as were ſpoken of that year of <hi>Jubilee.</hi> He ſaith, he was ſent to <hi>proclaim li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty</hi> to the Captives, and to proclaim the <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable year</hi> of the Lord. So that other De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverances, and other Freedoms, were but to uſher in this: They were but the Harbin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers of this great ſalvation: and in the read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>them,</hi> you muſt have your thoughts upon this, not only to read them as ſtories, that did but concern that people; but as ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowing out the great Goſpel-redemption.</p>
               <pb n="319" facs="tcp:64298:170"/>
               <p n="2">2. Again, 'tis an <hi>incomparable</hi> Freedom, thus, In that <hi>no miſery, is like that miſery which this Freedom brings us from.</hi> If ever there were a Wretch, indeed he is one that lies in that condition, out of which Chriſt was ſent to deliver us; 'tis ſuch a condition, that if one were truly ſenſible of it, he would not be in it one day for the whole World, I mean our <hi>natural condition,</hi> which is ſuch a miſerable ſtate, that if God bears ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting love to any perſon, to be ſure he brings him out of it; and if he intends e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting wrath to any, then he leaves them in it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Again, In that <hi>no mercy is like to that mercy which this Freedom brings us to:</hi> as they ſhall have miſery enough and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, that continue in the Bondage; ſo they ſhall have mercy enough and enough, that partake of this Freedom; they ſhall have mercy in abundance, they ſhall be monuments of mercy for ever; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God gives them this Freedom by his Son, that he may convey to them ſuch riches of Grace and Mercy, as that all the common goodneſs which is beſtowed upon the whole World in general, is as nothing in reſpect of that mercy which one ſingle redeemed perſon hath, and ſhall have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed upon him: But what this mercy is,
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:64298:171"/> we ſhall hear particularly when we come to ſpeak of the <hi>Priviledges</hi> of this Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>
               <p>Property <hi>2d.</hi> This Freedom is an <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceivable</hi> Freedom: that is, 'tis an <hi>unknown</hi> thing. Here take notice, 1. What I do not mean by this. 2. What I do mean by it. I do not mean by this, as if the Saints knew nothing of it. Oh! yes bleſſed be God they do, ſee 1 Pet. 1. 18, 19. <hi>Foraſmuch as ye know that ye were not redemed with cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible things,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>but with the precious blood of Chriſt.</hi>—So Coloſ. 1. 26, 27.—<hi>The myſtery which hath been hid from ages, and from generations, but now is made manifeſt unto his Saints.</hi> Mark thoſe words, <hi>'tis</hi> now made <hi>manifeſt</hi> to his Saints, and God <hi>would make it known</hi> to them; he was reſolved that his people in the days of the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> ſhould in a ſpecial man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner have it revealed to them; ſee alſo <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 6, 7. and <hi>cap.</hi> 3. 8, 9, 10, 11. Yea beloved, 'tis ſo made known now, as that there is not one Child of God upon Earth, but hath the knowledg of it, and none are altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ignorant of it, but ſuch as are in their loſt condition, 2 Cor. 4. 3, 4, 6. <hi>But if our Goſpel be hid, it is hid to them that are loſt.</hi>
                  <pb n="321" facs="tcp:64298:171"/> 
                  <hi>In whom the God of this World hath blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the minds of them which believed not, leſt the light of the glorious goſpel of Chriſt, who is the image of God, ſhould ſhine upon them: For God who commanded the light to ſhine out of darkneſs, hath ſhined in our heart, to give the light of the knowledg of the glory of God, in the face of Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> And therefore look you to it, you that live in darkneſs, and have none of this ſaving-light ſhining into your hearts, that cannot tell what to make of Chriſt and the Goſpel; you may ſee from this Scripture, what a caſe you are in, and to what company you belong for the preſent. God is teaching his people in theſe myſteries. It is written that <hi>they ſhall be all taught of God,</hi> and ſo they are, tho not to alike degree.</p>
               <p>That which I do mean, when I ſay that this is an <hi>unknown</hi> Freedom, is in theſe three things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That Gods people themſelves don't know it in that <hi>full manner</hi> and meaſure, as it is to be known. Surely there is more in it than they do underſtand, even they who ſee and know moſt of it. Nay,</p>
               <pb n="322" facs="tcp:64298:172"/>
               <p n="2">2. That which any of the people of God upon Earth do know of it, as yet is but little in compariſon of what is in this Freedom; and therefore they are ſaid to know but <hi>in part,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. Now you know, that but a part of a thing is very ſhort of the whole: They that have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained to the higheſt degree of ſpiritual underſtanding, had need pray that they might be carried further and further ſtill, as <hi>Paul</hi> doth for the <hi>Epheſians, cap.</hi> 1. 17, 18. <hi>and</hi> 3. 18, 19. Nay,</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Saints in Heaven it ſelf, will never be able to take in all that concerns the glory of this Freedom; tho they ſhall know it there clearly, yet they cannot know it fully; 'tis that which is too great for any but God to comprehend juſt as it is. He only knows his own Love, and his own Mercy to the utmoſt; yet this ſhall be no diminution of the Saints happineſs, that they cannot, even there, fully reach the knowledg of it; for they ſhall know as much of it as it is poſſible for a Grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to know; they ſhall be like Bottles caſt into the Sea, that tho they cannot take in the Sea, yet they ſhall take in ſo much as ſhall make them ſo full that they cannot hold a drop more; but if they could take
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:64298:172"/> in more, there is more ſtill to be taken in. So that indeed this is an unconceivable Fredoom; the Saints do admire it, and they will admire it for ever: Now our admiring of things, doth not only pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from our being affected with them, but alſo from hence, that there is more in them than we can well dive into; ſo we cannot go to the bottom of this Freedom, nor ever ſhall, for it hath no bottom: So that the truth is, here we are all poſed; Saints, and Angels are poſed to conceive what this Freedom comes to. You may go to ſome in the World, that can ſcarch out deep Myſteries, that can expound Riddles; but this is ſuch a Myſtery, and ſuch a Riddle as no Creature in Heaven or Earth is able exactly to unfold. I may ſay of it, as 'tis in Rom. 11. 33. <hi>O the depth,</hi> &amp;c. Other Freedoms you can fathom, but this you can't.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>3d Property,</hi> It is the moſt <hi>honourable</hi> Freedom; you know when God redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> out of <hi>Egypt;</hi> he did it in an honourable way; take it in theſe three things.</p>
               <pb n="324" facs="tcp:64298:173"/>
               <p n="1">1. He gat honour to <hi>himſelf, Exod.</hi> 14. 17, 18. by this he declared himſelf to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all gods, and above all great Ones of the Earth: God ſhould never have done this work if the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> and all their Idols could have hindred it: You know what a fierce on-ſet they made upon <hi>Iſrael</hi> at the Red-Sea to bring them back again; but inſtead of that, they never went back again themſelves; the waters covered their Enemies, there was not one of them left; what a name did the Lord make him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf at that time!</p>
               <p n="2">2. He honoured his <hi>Promiſes;</hi> the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> had had many Promiſes of Deliverance, which by reaſon of the anguiſh of their ſpirits in their Bondage, they could not tell how to believe; they called the Faithfulneſs and Truth of God into queſtion, (as we are too ready to do, when we are in great ſtraits;) inſtead of truſting in God firmly, as they ſhould have done, when once they had a word from God, what depth of diſtreſs ſoever they were in; they did not rely up-God's Promiſe, <hi>Exod.</hi> 6. 6, 7, 8, 9. But when God delivered them, he honoured his Promiſe for all that, he ſhewed that he did remember it by the performing of
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:64298:173"/> it, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. 41. <hi>And it came to paſs at the end of the four hundred and thirty years, even the ſelf-ſame day it came to paſs, that all the hoſts of the Lord went out of the land of Egypt.</hi> You muſt know, that this place looks back chiefly to the promiſe that God made to <hi>Abraham,</hi> that tho his <hi>ſeed ſhould be afflicted in Egypt,</hi> yet <hi>he would bring them out</hi> after ſuch a time, <hi>Gen.</hi> 15. 13, 14. Now here in this <hi>12th</hi> of <hi>Exod.</hi> you ſee how God honoured his promiſe, he kept his word <hi>to the very day.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Obj. <hi>But how did God honour his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe? and how were they delivered the ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſame day, when as in that place of</hi> Geneſis, <hi>there is juſt Four hundred years ſpoken of, that they ſhould be in</hi> Egypt; <hi>and in the other of</hi> Exodus, <hi>'tis Four hundred and Thirty years? It ſeems therefore, that God failed of his promiſe Thirty years?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> No: God forbid that we ſhould think ſo: <hi>Heaven and earth ſhall paſs away, but one tittle of his word ſhall not periſh.</hi> But you muſt know, that there may be Two <hi>Reaſons</hi> why the Thirty years are not men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in the promiſe to <hi>Abraham.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="326" facs="tcp:64298:174"/> (1.) Becauſe 'tis not an unuſual thing amongſt us, to ſwallow up a leſſer number in a greater: As if a man ask you, how old you are, you ſay, ſo many years; and tho there be ſome odd weeks, or months, you omit them, putting the greateſt number for all. So the Thirty years are to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood in the Four hundred, as the Text in <hi>Exodus,</hi> with which the other is to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared, doth ſhew.</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) I ſuppoſe the Lord might of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe conceal theſe Thirty years (tho he did as much intend them as the other), that his people might not preciſely know the very time when their deliverance ſhould be, that it ſhould be this year, or this day, to teach them ſtill to depend upon him for deliverance, even when they might think that their deliverance was neareſt. We muſt truſt God for deliverance: but the very time when it ſhall be, we muſt leave that to him. He uſeth to reſerve that in his own breaſt. But to go on.</p>
               <p n="3">3. In that deliverance God honoured his <hi>people,</hi> Deut. 4. 34. Iſa. 43. 3, 4. He gat them a Name, and made them high above all Nations. They were a People that all the World did talk of, that heard what
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:64298:174"/> God had done for them; how he had redeemed them, and how he had cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen them, and how he went before them.</p>
               <p>Well now, beloved, you ſee this was an honourable deliverance that God gave to them; but this Freedom by Chriſt is the moſt honourable Freedom of all. God ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo honoured himſelf by any deliverance as by this: nor did he ever ſo honour his promiſes; nor did he ever ſo honour his people. For the firſt, ſee <hi>John</hi> 12. 28. for the ſecond, <hi>Luke</hi> 1. 68. to 74. for the third, <hi>Luke</hi> 2. 32. They are ſo honoured by this, that they that partake of this Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, are ſaid to be made <hi>Kings to God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Property</hi> 4. This Freedom is a <hi>Heavenly</hi> Freedom. They who are intereſted in it, are ſaid to be <hi>partakers of the heavenly calling,</hi> Heb. 3. 1. And they are called the <hi>hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Jeruſalem,</hi> cap. 12. 22. and <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> which is <hi>above,</hi> Gal. 4. 26. 'Tis ſuch an Heavenly Freedom, that the very Angels deſire to look into this ſalvation which it brings, 1 Pet. 1. 10, 11, 12. Other Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verances were <hi>earthly;</hi> or at moſt, the beſt and greateſt of them, as I ſaid, were but
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:64298:175"/> types and ſhadows of better things: but this Freedom is all made up of <hi>Heavenli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi> I ſhall make out this by Four things a little:</p>
               <p>1. It is the <hi>Sons</hi> Freedom. 2. The <hi>Souls</hi> Freedom. 3. The <hi>Saints</hi> Freedom. 4. The <hi>Scripture-</hi>Freedom.</p>
               <p n="1">1. I ſay 'tis the <hi>Sons</hi> Freedom; that which the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, the Son of God hath procured. 'Tis the Son that makes free. You have had this largely o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to you. Now what an heavenly Freedom muſt this be, that God imployed his own Son in, and ſent him from Heaven on purpoſe about it? When the Lord would redeem his people out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> he ſent <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> for that work; and they were but Men; but when he would give this Freedom, he ſent one that was more than a Man. 'Tis true, he raiſed up Chriſt from amongſt the <hi>Jews,</hi> according to the fleſh; and the humane Nature did not come immediately from God, but 'twas made of the Seed of <hi>David.</hi> Yea, but <hi>God</hi> was manifeſted in this fleſh: and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this account he is ſaid to <hi>come down from Heaven,</hi> John 3. 13. and to come <hi>out</hi>
                  <pb n="329" facs="tcp:64298:175"/> 
                  <hi>from God,</hi> and to come forth <hi>from the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> cap. 16. 27, 28. So that in this Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, beloved, there came one from the <hi>Throne of God;</hi> yea, one that was <hi>God,</hi> to give it to us.</p>
               <p n="2">2. 'Tis the <hi>Souls</hi> Freedom; the Freedom of the Soul. Now you know they muſt be all heavenly things that can reach that, to do it any good. In other Deliverances they were the <hi>Bodies</hi> of men that were ſet free; but in this Chriſt brings <hi>Souls</hi> out of Priſon and Bondage. And indeed, herein lies the very main of all the excellency of this Freedom, that it is a Freedom for Souls. If I ſhould have ſaid nothing elſe about it, but only this, That the precious Souls of Men and Women are redeemed by it, you muſt needs have ſaid 'tis an excellent Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. Yea, beloved, all that I have ſaid, or have yet to ſay, or can ſay, runs into this. Oh bleſſed, joyful, heavenly Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom by Chriſt! What a thing is this! What, to bring ſalvation to <hi>Souls!</hi> to ſet the Heart, Mind, Will, Underſtanding, Affections, Conſcience at liberty; that when all was bound within with ſpiritual Chains and Fetters, that were Ten thouſand times ſtronger than thoſe that are made of Braſs and Iron: that when the <hi>Soul</hi> ſat in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:64298:176"/> and in the ſhadow of death, there ſhould be redemption for that! that Chriſt ſhould pity loſt and undone <hi>ſouls!</hi> Oh heavenly, heavenly, heavenly Freedom! Well may I uſe thoſe words to you here, which the Angel uſed to the Shepherds, <hi>Luke</hi> 2. 10, 11. <hi>Behold I bring you good ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings of great joy, which ſhall be to all peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: for unto you is born this day in the city of David, a Savioue, which is Chriſt the Lord.</hi> Here's a Saviour for your Souls! Where are your Souls, Sirs, by Nature? What a condition are they in? Oh! they are kept the cloſeſt Priſoners that ever were, in the deepeſt darkeſt Dungeon that ever was: and this Priſon they are caſt into for Debt, for Theft, for Murder, for Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; and no Debt like this Debt: for 'tis the Debt of Sins and Iniquities; and no Theft like this Theft; for 'tis for robbing God of his Glory; and no Murder like this Mruder; for 'tis for deſtroying your own Souls; and no Treaſon like this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; for tis againſt the Crown of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. And yet if you will <hi>repent, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve</hi> the Goſpel, here's a Freedom for your Souls out of all this. Methinks it ſhould be even with us in the hearing of this, as 'tis ſaid in <hi>Luke</hi> 19. 37, 38. <hi>that we</hi>
                  <pb n="331" facs="tcp:64298:176"/> 
                  <hi>ſhould rejoyce, and praiſe God with a loud voice.</hi> And if we ſhould not be affected with this Freedom, one might think, as <hi>ver.</hi> 40. that if we ſhould hold our peace, the ſtones would immediately cry out.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It is the <hi>Saints</hi> Freedom. Indeed 'tis to make ſinners free; but it is not the Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of ſinners: That is, as long as perſons are out of Chriſt, they cannot truly call it theirs. 'Tis the portion and priviledg of the children of God. A wicked man <hi>may</hi> have it, but a true Believer <hi>hath</hi> it. The one is under a <hi>poſſibility</hi> of it, but the other is in <hi>poſſeſſion</hi> of it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 2. They have their <hi>ſtanding</hi> in this Grace. They ſtand upon Goſpel-ground. Now what a Heavenly Freedom is this, that none but Saints enjoy! The men of the World may enjoy other Freedoms, but one muſt be in Chriſt to enjoy this. It belongs to the holy Company, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 19. Ye are Fellow-Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens <hi>with the Saints.</hi> Indeed this Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom doth not <hi>find us</hi> Saints, but it <hi>makes us</hi> ſo. And therefore hereby you may know whether you have any thing of it. Do you think that you are made free by Chriſt, and abide ungodly? To be ſure you deceive your ſelves. The Lord Chriſt
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:64298:177"/> never redeemed any Soul, to leave it where he found it; he puts it into a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary ſtate to that which it had before; he found it in darkneſs, but he puts it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Light; he found it in Death, but he puts it into Life; he found it in Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, but he puts it into Righteouſneſs; he changes the perſon whom he frees, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 17. and continuance in ſin is a certain ſign that this Redeemer hath not yet been there.</p>
               <p n="4">4. It is the <hi>Scripture-</hi>Freedom: Belov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, tho you read, as I ſaid, of other Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms in the Scripture, yet this is <hi>the Scripture</hi> Freedom Joh. 5. 39. <hi>Search the Scriptures,—and they are they which teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie of me.</hi> You know what <hi>heavenly</hi> things are contained in the Scriptures: Why now, beloved, this Freedom by Chriſt is the great thing that the Scripture treat of; all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things that are there ſpoken of, are but in order to this; all its Precepts, all its Promiſes, all its Threatnings look this way. It is, as I may call it, the <hi>ſubſtance</hi> of the Scripture; that would not ſpeak of ſin ſo as is doth, if it were not for this Freedom; it would not ſpeak of Chriſt ſo as it doth, if it were not for this Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; it would not ſpeak of Death and
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:64298:177"/> Judgment, and Heaven and Hell, ſo as it doth, if it were not for this Freedom. Yea beloved, 'tis a queſtion whether we ſhould have had any written word at all, if it had not been for this Freedom; this is the great thing that the Scripture com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, and the great thing that the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture commends; it bleſſes all them that have it, and it curſes all them that have it not. And, which is an unſpeakable comfort to think of, when a poor Soul hath this Freedom by Chriſt, 'tis then <hi>Freed by Scripture;</hi> it is in a good condition <hi>by Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;</hi> there be many that think themſelves in a good condition, but they have no Scripture-grounds for it; ask them how they prove their hopes; they have not one word to ſhew for it in the whole Book of God; but now the Scripture will come and joyn with one that is freed by Chriſt; it will help him to read his Freedom there; and he is one, that however he may be fearing and queſtioning his condition for a time, yet at laſt he will come to this, to be able to ſay, why Lord I am freed <hi>by thine own word;</hi> certainly this is a <hi>heavenly</hi> Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom then, which the Holy Scriptures are ſo much taken up with. You ſee now by all that hath ſaid upon this <hi>fourth</hi> Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:64298:178"/> What great Reaſon there is for that Text of Scripture, Eph. 2. 6. <hi>And hath raiſed us up together, and made us ſit toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in heavenly places in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> This is done by this heavenly Freedom.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>5th Property,</hi> This Freedom is a <hi>perfect</hi> Freedom; it is ſo already in Chriſt; and by that time he hath done what he intends to do in and for his people, it ſhall be ſo to them. You know the Apoſtle tells the <hi>Coloſſians, cap.</hi> 2. 11. that they were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat in him. It hath not only the perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of <hi>parts,</hi> as a Child hath, that hath all the members, tho they be not grown; but it hath the perfection of <hi>degrees,</hi> as a man hath that is at his full ſtature. Chriſt's Freedom as it is in himſelf, is full grown; and therefore 'tis able to do great things for us, as you know; if you ſpeak to a Child to help you, he can do but little; but ſpeak to a man that is grown, and in his ſtrength, he can powerfully aſſiſt you. And oh! what a vaſt difference there is between the Freedom that man can give, and the Freedom that Chriſt can give! men may be inſtrumental to deliver us one way, but then they cannot another way; the Creatures arm is too ſhort to reach
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:64298:178"/> us, and his hand too weak to help us in every ſtrait: But this Freedom by Chriſt is ſuch a perfect thing, that in whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver we have need of it, 'tis as able to help us in one as in t'other. Beloved, there was never ſuch a Saviour as Chriſt is, of all the Saviours that ever God raiſed up to do his people good; <hi>he is able to ſave to the utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt.</hi> When God made uſe of them to be Saviours and Deliverers to his Church, yet ſtill his Church needed another Saviour, and they did not ſave them from their greateſt dangers; but now in Jeſus Chriſt the Church hath got ſuch a Saviour, that they need none other, I mean as to ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Deliverance.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>6th Property,</hi> And ſo I ſhall end this fourth thing. This Freedom is an <hi>eternal</hi> Freedom. Amongſt men, tho perſons may be ſet free at one time, yet they may come into Bondage at another time; a man may be twice a Slave, and twice a Priſoner, yea many times; but 'tis not ſo here. Where Chriſt gives this Freedom, he ſettles it for ever, Heb. 9. 12. <hi>Having obtained eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Redemption for us.</hi> It is very true, there will be great and ſtrong endeavours put forth by the Enemies of thoſe whom
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:64298:179"/> he hath redeemed, to recoverthem again, as it was in <hi>Iſrael</hi>'s caſe; but they'l be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrown in their undertaking, as <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and his Hoſt was. Satans furious attempts to keep thoſe Souls ſtill in Bondage, whom Chriſt will have to be delivered, and to brings back thoſe Souls into Bondage whom Chriſt hath made free, will coſt him the <hi>fall of his Kingdom;</hi> and it will be ſuch a fall, as he and all the forces of Hell that he can raiſe, will never be able to get it up again.</p>
               <p>Well now, beloved, having heard the Properties of this Freedom, give me leave to ask you, How do you like it? as when a man brings a thing to you, and bids you make trial of it, and ſee the Conditions and properties of it; when he comes to you again, he will ſay, Well, how do you like it? So, pray now, how do you like this Freedom? What, are you pleaſed or diſpleaſed with it? Will you have it, or will you not? what fault can you find in it? Why ſurely Sirs, 'tis not to be miſliked; is not an <hi>incomparable, unconceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,</hi> moſt <hi>honourable, heavenly</hi> Freedom to be liked? What, is there any of you here ſo diſdainful as wont like the Freedom of the <hi>Son?</hi> the Freedom of the <hi>Soul?</hi> the Freedom of the <hi>Saints?</hi> the Freedom of the <hi>Scripture?</hi> Can't you find in your
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:64298:179"/> hearts to like Chriſt's <hi>perfect, eternal</hi> Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom? Why then what can you like? Truly, I may even ſay of ſuch as cannot like this, as <hi>Job</hi> doth, cap. 33. of very diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſed perſons, <hi>whoſe ſoul abhorreth dain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty meat</hi> (in <hi>verſ.</hi> 20.) Your <hi>Soul</hi> (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out infinite mercy) <hi>draweth nigh to the grave, and your life to the deſtroyers,</hi> verſ. 22.</p>

                  <hi>Concerning the excellent Priviledges which this Freedom brings with it.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>FIfthly, This is an excellent Freedom in reſpect of the excellent <hi>Priviledges</hi> which it brings with it. I have formerly told you, that this is a purchaſed Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; and now I am to tell you that it is a <hi>priviledged</hi> Freedom, it is full of good things. They who are redeemed by Chriſt, are an <hi>heavenly Corporation, the City of the living God.</hi> Now <hi>Corporations</hi> and <hi>Cities</hi> have their <hi>Priviledges,</hi> and ſome have greater than others; but none ſo
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:64298:180"/> great as theſe; that Scripture may well come in here, Pſal. 87. 3. <hi>Glorious things are ſpoken of thee, O thou City of God.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved, I would fain engage your moſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious attention to what ſhall be delivered upon this Subject; and to prepare you for it, I beſeech you to know, that I hope you ſhall hear ſome glorious things ſpoken to you of this City of God, in the open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the excellent Priviledges which this Freedom by Chriſt brings with it; which when you have heard, I am ſure you will have cauſe to ſay of theſe redeemed ones, as <hi>Moſes</hi> once did of the Children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> Deut. 33. 29. <hi>Happy art thou, O Iſrael: who is like unto thee, O people, ſaved by the Lord.</hi> I ſhall not ſpend time in things that are but of a general conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration; otherwiſe I might ſhew you, that there muſt needs be very precious Priviledges attending this Freedom. 1. From the great difficulty that there is to get in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this Freedom. As you know thoſe places and conditions, that have great Priviledges, what a hard thing 'tis to get into them; there muſt be a great deal of ſeeking, and waiting, and much coſt and pains laid out, and ſuch and ſuch a great perſon muſt be made ones friend; ſo 'tis
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:64298:180"/> no eaſie matter to get into this Freedom, to be made one of the Company. If ever you be admitted into it, you muſt <hi>ſtrive to enter:</hi> you muſt think no pains or labour, too much; and you muſt patiently wait upon the Lord, till he have mercy on you: and you muſt be ſure to get God and Chriſt to be your friends; for they have the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and the diſpoſing of this Freedom; they give it to whom they will. Now what's the Reaſon that there is ſo much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do amongſt men, to procure ſuch a Place, and to be one of ſuch a Society, as many times there is? Why, 'tis becauſe, if they were once admitted into it, there be ſuch Priviledges to be enjoyed, and ſuch profits to be received, as will abundantly recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence all their pains. So here, the difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of becoming one of theſe that are made free by Chriſt, ſpeaks that this Freedom is full of excellent Priviledges, 2. From the high eſteem that they have of this Freedom, who are admitted into it through Grace. Say what you will to them, you can never bring them out of love with it again; they'l like their Chriſt, and like their Condition, tho all the world ſhould ſet themſelves to turn away their hearts from it. They'l part with if for no good.
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:64298:181"/> They like it ſo well, that they ſet an high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er value upon the worſt of Chriſt, than they do upon the beſt of the World, as <hi>Moſes</hi> did, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 25, 26. Now cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly this is becauſe their condition is full of <hi>Priviledges.</hi> They know they are bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter here than they can be any where elſe in the World. 3. From the conſideration of the Saints being ſo often called upon in Scripture to <hi>praiſe the Lord.</hi> They who obſerve, may frequently find how much they are ſtirred up to this duty. How ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>Pſalms</hi> doth <hi>David</hi> begin and end with this, <hi>Praiſe ye the Lord?</hi> And he ſays, that the People of God ſhould be a ſinging to him, bleſſing of him, rejoycing, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving thanks, extolling of the Name of God, declaring his wonderful Works towards them. Now you ſhall ſee, that one main thing that he drove at, why they ſhould do this, was upon the account of the <hi>Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> which God had brought them into, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 107. 1, 2. and 136. 1, 2, 3. compared with <hi>ver.</hi> 10, 11, 12, 23, 24. And in <hi>Rev.</hi> 5. you read, that the Saints were at this work of more than ordinary thankſgivings to God: They ſung a Song: What is it for? Oh! for the Freedom they had received. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly then, if God hath ſuch great praiſes
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:64298:181"/> for it, there are great Priviledges in it. But I ſhall not go on thus; but will bring in a Liſt of the Priviledges (ſo far as I can) in particular. And here, as the Prophet ſaid, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 63. 7. <hi>I will mention the loving kindneſs of the Lord,</hi> &amp;c. They are a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledged people. For,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Priviledg</hi> 1. Being made free by Chriſt, they are <hi>tranſlated out of the Kingdom of the Devil.</hi> His Priſon-doors are now o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, that were ſhut ſo faſt upon them, as that none could open them, but <hi>he that hath the key of David.</hi> Now their bondage under that great Tyrant over Souls, is at an end. He ſhall no more have them captive at his will: The yoke of their op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion is broken; See <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 13. <hi>Who hath delivered us from the power of darkneſs, and hath tranſlated us into the kingdom of his dear Son.</hi> They are redeemed from the hand of the terrible. <hi>Satan</hi> hath been for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to yield them up; and now he can lay no more claim to them. This Priviledg you read of further in <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 14, 15. <hi>That through death he might deſtroy him that had the power of death, that is, the Devil; and deliver them who all their life-time were ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to bondage.</hi> Mark, he hath delivered
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:64298:182"/> them from the Devil, by <hi>deſtroying</hi> of him; not as to his Being; for the Devil is not dead: 'tis not the Nature of a Spirit to die; but as to his power over them. So he is deſtroyed; he is quite routed, as to any ſlavery that he now keeps them in. He may Lord it over his Vaſſals, whoſe God he is; but with theſe he hath nothing to do, but in a way of moleſtation: ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed he will <hi>vex them</hi> all that he can: and he won't be wanting to follow them with his Temptations, and his ſiery Darts. In this kind theſe redeemed ones muſt expect a War with him, <hi>Eph.</hi> 6. 11, 12, 13, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Chriſt will have them fight, tho he hath made them free; and tho the Devil doth ceaſe to be their Owner, yet he doth not ceaſe to be their Enemy: and he deſigns all the hurt and miſchief to them that poſſibly he can; for they went out of his Kingdom againſt his will and conſent. If he could have ſtaid them, they ſhould never have gone. And therefore his wrath is the more kindled againſt them, and that to ſuch a degree, that he is not only compared to an Adverſary, but to a <hi>Lion:</hi> and this Lion is in the ſierceſt poſture of all: he is a <hi>roar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> Lion. But notwithſtanding all his rage, his Dominion is gone. Now beloved, this
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:64298:182"/> is an excellent Priviledg: Oh, to be looſed from the Chains of Darkneſs! to be turned <hi>from the power of Satan to God!</hi> In this ſenſe, they that are made free by Chriſt, are paſt the Devil's Quarters. And therefore tho they ſhould diligently watch againſt him, yet they ſhould not be ſlaviſhly afraid of him. Do but keep Gods way, and what hurt can he do you? See <hi>John</hi> 5. 18. 'Tis a very unbecoming thing, for a child of God to be afraid of the Devil. What have all the Devils in Hell to do with you, for whom Chriſt ſhed his precious Blood? He himſelf knows that you are none of his; and therefore ſanctifie the Lord God in your hearts, and let him be your fear, and let him be your dread. 'Tis meet that you ſhould ſtand in awe of him with a holy fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lial fear: But as for the Devil, you are no longer his.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Priviledg</hi> 2. This Freedom brings the <hi>pardon</hi> of ſin, which is ſuch a Priviledg, that <hi>David</hi> could not tell how to think of it, or mention it, without wondring at the bleſſedneſs of the man that hath it, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 32. 12. <hi>Bleſſed is he whoſe tranſgreſſion is forgiven, whoſe ſin is covered. Bleſſed is the man unto whom the Lord imputeth not</hi>
                  <pb n="344" facs="tcp:64298:183"/> 
                  <hi>iniquity, and in whoſe ſpirit there is no guile:</hi> or, as 'tis in the <hi>Hebrew, Oh the bleſſedneſs of the man,</hi> &amp;c. You would count it a great Priviledg, to have a man to forgive you a great debt, when you can ſay, I ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſuch a perſon ſuch a great ſum of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny; 'twas as due a debt, as ever any was in the World: and tho I was not able to pay him, yet he might have had the Law againſt me; he might have caſt me into Priſon, and there have kept me all the days of my life: but out of his meer goodneſs he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gave me all: and he hath not only told me, that he will never trouble me for it, but hath given me in the Bond too. Why then, what a great Priviledg muſt it be, to have God to forgive us the great debt of our ſins! for him to ſay, Well, I know, and you know too, in ſome meaſure, what a grievous man or woman you have been; what abundance of diſhonour and provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation I have had with you. Oh the <hi>wicked Nature</hi> that you have! Oh the wicked <hi>Life</hi> that you have led! Oh the wicked <hi>thoughts</hi> that you have thought! <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now how might I make the fire of mine indignation burn againſt you? What a wretch would you be, if I ſhould deal with you accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to your deſerts! But here I do in my
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:64298:183"/> infinite mercy, paſs all by: Inſtead of gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving you <hi>puniſhment,</hi> I give you a <hi>pardon.</hi> Why, this is the Priviledg of this Freedom by Chriſt, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 7. <hi>In whom we have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption through his blood, the forgiveneſs of ſins, according to the riches of his grace.</hi> And from hence it follows, that now being par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned, God doth not upbraid his people with their ſins, buthe forgets them in that ſenſe, tho he cannot but remember them by way of knowledg, ſo as to underſtand that they have been committed; yet he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets them, as to laying them to their charge. In that reſpect he will hear nothing againſt them, not what the Devil ſays by his Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations; not what the Law ſaith in regard of its Threatnings and Condemnation. The whole courſe of the Laws proceeding this way, is utterly and eternally ſtopt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 1. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 13. And being par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned, they are <hi>juſtiffed</hi> in the ſight of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 24. tho they will, it may be, condemn themſelves an hundred, and a thouſand times after this, and confeſs, and bewail their ſins, and loathe themſelves in their own eyes, and acknowledg that the Lord might juſtly caſt them into the deepeſt torments (as 'tis fit they ſhould); yet in and through Chriſt, God doth not look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:64298:184"/> them ſo as they look upon themſelves. And again, being pardoned, God is <hi>recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled</hi> to them: his heart is towards them. But yet there muſt be ſomething more ſtill, than the pardon of ſin, to make a child of God count himſelf a happy man. Yea, you'l ſay, that's ſtrange<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I ſhould think my ſelf happy enough, if my ſins were but for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given me. I, no queſtion of it: But tho a child of God count this an unſpeakable mercy, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51. 1. yet if there were not ſomething elſe joyned with it, a great part of his happineſs would be wanting; and that is the <hi>ſubduing</hi> of ſin. Which therefore is the next.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Priviledg</hi> 3. This Freedom brings down the <hi>Dominion of ſin,</hi> Rom. 6. 14. <hi>Sin ſhall not have dominion over you.</hi> You that are in your ſins, I know, unleſs God come and work upon you, you would look upon it as no Priviledg at all to have your Luſts curbed. No, you would look upon your ſelves as undone, if you ſhould not have your ſwinge in them, they are ſo dear to you. This is a ſign the Redeemer hath not been with you: But 'tis otherwiſe in thoſe that are Chriſts: As he hath broken the Yoke of their Souls, ſo he makes a
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:64298:184"/> Yoke for their Corruption, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11. 29. Sin muſt reign no more. Before, Pride reigned, and Paſſion reigned, or Unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or Worldlineſs, and ſuch like. Now the Crown muſt be taken off from them; they muſt ſit no longer upon the Throne of the Heart, giving out their Commands, and the poor creature fulfilling of them, tho it be to his own deſtruction. But eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Luſt muſt be mortified, and every vile Affection diſcountenanced, and nothing pleaded for, or yeilded to, that proceeds from the Law of Sin, and of Death. And this now the people of God count a Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg indeed; Oh! that they are brought into a ſtate wherein their ſins ſhall not, nor can have their head! Oh, how they bleſs God for this Freedom upon this account, that it is an inlet to mortification! for ſo you read it is, in <hi>Tit.</hi> 2. 11, 12. So that no child of God is under the Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of any ſin, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 24. He that is ſo, is in Bondage ſtill, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 16. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 19.</p>
               <p>And yet ſtill there is ſomething more about ſin, than all this, to make him look upon his Priviledges (ſo far as they do concern that) to be compleat; he cannot count himſelf a happy man indeed, neither
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:64298:185"/> with the pardon of his ſins, or that ſin doth not reign in him, tho he is glad of this at his very heart; but this ſame loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome thing ſin is in him ſtill, what ſhall he do for that? <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 24. Therefore this is another Priviledge that this Freedom will produce.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Priviledg</hi> 4. The very <hi>being</hi> of ſin in them ſhall ere long be done quite away, <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 22. <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 26, 27. 'Tis not thus yet; tho the Saints have put on the <hi>new man,</hi> yet they have not perfectly put off the <hi>old;</hi> there are excellent things in them, but 'tis with a blemiſh, they have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to blemiſh them, as well as ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to beautifie them. As you know 'tis with a Traveller, as long as he is in his journey, eſpecially, if he be to go againſt wind and weather, he is apt to daſh his Cloaths; if he were but at home, there he would beneat and clean, and you ſhould not ſee one ſpot upon him from head to foot; but while he is a travelling, he gets theſe ſpots, and he cannot tell how to help it. So here, tho while the people of God are in their paſſage, 'tis not all ſo well in them, and with them, as God would have it; nor as themſelves would have it; but
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:64298:185"/> ſhortly when they come home, their ſpots will be all out. Thou Child of God ſhall have no more of this deadneſs, no more of this hardneſs and unbelief of heart; here thou canſt not pray one quarter of an hour without vain thoughts; there thou ſhalt praiſe and glorifie him to all eternity without the leaſt diſtraction. Oh! what a Priviledge will this be, when ſin and you ſhall be quite parted! Now you hear of it in every duty; but there you may be good as long and as much as you will, and no evil to hinder you; <hi>Paul</hi>'s com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint is now at an end as to himſelf, becauſe he is at home, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 21.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Priviledge</hi> 5. They who are made free by Chriſt, are made nigh to God, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 13. <hi>But now in Chriſt Jeſus, ye who ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times were far off, are made nigh by the Blood of Chriſt.</hi> As the people of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> whom he redeemed out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a <hi>people near to God,</hi> Pſal. 147. 14. You know 'tis counted a Priviledg to ſtand near to an earthly King in ſome caſes. The <hi>Queen of Sheba</hi> pronounced the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of <hi>Solomon happy</hi> upon this account, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 10. 8. But as Chriſt ſaid once of himſelf, a <hi>greater than Solomon is here;</hi> here's the King of Heaven and Earth, that
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:64298:186"/> is the moſt <hi>high</hi> God, and theſe are near to <hi>him;</hi> whatſoever is <hi>dear</hi> to us, is near to us. Now the Saints are very <hi>dear</hi> to God: How dear is a Friend to you? And how dear are your Children to you? And how dear is the Apple of your eye to you? Why by theſe names, the Lord calls his people in the Scripture. Yea beloved, the Lord is very near to them, when they think he is far off from them, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73. 23. don't make account that God is at ſuch a diſtance from you, you that belong to him, as many times you do; you think he is gone away, ſo that he will never return, and all that while he is hard by you, if you could but ſee him; remember what he ſaith in Iſa. 41. 10. <hi>Fear thou not, for I am with thee,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Priviledg</hi> 6. This Freedom brings Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with Chriſt, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 30. it joyns thoſe to him, who are redeemed by an inſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable bond; Chriſt is <hi>in them,</hi> and they are <hi>in him:</hi> therefore <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith Gal. 2. 20. that <hi>Chriſt liveth in him;</hi> and 'tis ſaid of the Saints, that Chriſt <hi>dwells in their</hi> hearts by Faith, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3. 17. and Chriſt and they are not to be conſidered as two, but as one; he owns them as his Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:64298:186"/> and you know they are one with the head; as his Wife, and ſhe is one with the Husband. Now what an unſpeakable Priviledg is it to be <hi>united to</hi> Jeſus Chriſt, and what greater honour can a Soul deſire, or enjoy, than this is? If you have ſuch a deal of comfort from thoſe earthly Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in which you ſtand one to another, as ſome of you have; tho this is a Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a low degree in compariſon of this; yet you find there is much ſweetneſs in being joyned to a loving Wife, or a loving Husband: Oh, what is it to be joyned to the Lord Jeſus Chriſt!</p>
               <p>Obj. But you'l ſay, <hi>What's a bare <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion, if there be no Communications from him? if Chriſt doth not give out that which he is, and that which he hath to us? there's many a one that is joyned to another in an uniting Relation, that is little the better for it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> Yea, but to be ſure, they who are one with Chriſt ſhall be the better for it; for in the next place,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Priviledg</hi> 7. From this Union flows Communion with Chriſt, and a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication from Chriſt of abundance
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:64298:187"/> of good things to them. I will inſtance in ſome, 1. They partake of his likeneſs and image; to this you read, that they were of old <hi>predeſtinated, Rom.</hi> 8. 29. Hence they are ſaid to have <hi>put on Chriſt:</hi> as ſoon as ever he brought them into this Freedom, he began preſently, as I may ſay, to draw his Picture upon them, and they grow more and more like him, every day, by reſembling of him in his Graces and walking: The Saints deſire to live no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther life, but that which is ſuitable to the life that Chriſt led; and they would fain imitate and follow him in his holy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation; they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> mightily taken with it; all their trouble is that they can reach it no more. 2. They partake of his <hi>ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Joh.</hi> 1. 16. 'Tis their Priviledg, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made free by him, to be fetching from him what they need; for tho he hath it <hi>in himſelf<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> yet he doth not keep it <hi>to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf;</hi> no, he means to be liberal of what he hath to all his Members. He is not like the Rich covetous men of the World, that tho they have abundance, yet they hoard it up; they have no readineſs in them to diſtribute; but Chriſt is all for diſtributing; and that which his redeemed ones have had, and ſhall have from him,
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:64298:187"/> is an unknown deal. 3. They partake of his <hi>Death and Reſurrection,</hi> Rom. 6. 5. They dye to ſin by the vertue of Chriſts Death, and they live to God by the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of Chriſts riſing again: For beloved, Chriſt did not do thoſe things barely, that they ſhould end in himſelf, that none ſhould have a fellowſhip with him in them. But his deſign was, that his Death ſhould bring forth another Death, and his Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection another Reſurrection in the Souls of his people; that they ſhould feel in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, that he died by their being crucifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſin, and crucified to the World, and that they ſhould feel in themſelves, that he roſe by their newneſs of life, and by their ſetting their affections upon things above. Now this is a great Priviledg, to have the experience of theſe things with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in us; people talk how Chriſt died and roſe again; but where is our conformity to this? Oh! how little doth the power and the virtue of this come to us? 4. They partake of his <hi>Righteouſneſs;</hi> I mean, 'tis imputed to them as their own, that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect unſpotted obedience of his, 'tis to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver all the unrighteouſneſs that is in them, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5 <hi>ult.</hi> Oh, beloved, what a thing is this that a righteouſneſs that is juſt as the
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:64298:188"/> Scripture would have it, without the leaſt defect, wherein all the holy rules and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of the word are fulfilled to a tit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, that this ſhould be made over to one, with as great and ſure an intereſt in it, as if one had done all this in ones perſon! why thus 'tis with thoſe whom Chriſt hath made free. 5. They partake of his <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion;</hi> the Lord Jeſus is at the right hand of the Father on their behalf, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 24. he is ſpeaking good words to God for them continually; and his interceſſion is powerful. Oh, with what great Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments can Chriſt back all the requeſts that he makes to his Father for them, even from what himſelf hath done, and ſuffered, and ſatisfied? 6. They ſhall partake with Chriſt in his <hi>Glory;</hi> many of them are come to it already; and to make it ſure, that not one of his redeemed ones ſhall miſs of it, he intends to come himſelf and bring them all thither, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14. 3. So that not only Chriſt hath a Crown; but they ſhall have one too; a Crown of life, a Crown of Righteouſneſs; <hi>becauſe I live,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>ye ſhall live alſo;</hi> and he doth not count him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf fully glorified, till he hath got every particular Saint into Heaven. And not only have the people of God upon Earth great longings after Chriſt; oh, that we
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:64298:188"/> might be with him! but ſurely Chriſt hath greater longings after them: oh, that they might be with me!</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Priviledg</hi> 8. The <hi>indwelling</hi> of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit is another Priviledg, bought by this Freedom; Chriſt having freed them, the Holy Ghoſt takes poſſeſſion of them; now their <hi>Bodies</hi> muſt be his <hi>Temples,</hi> and their <hi>Hearts</hi> his <hi>Throne,</hi> Rom. 8. 11. and oh, the great things that his Spirit doth in them and for them! which I might ſet down as diſtinct Priviledges. But I muſt haſten. By this they are <hi>enlightned;</hi> by this they are <hi>ſanctified;</hi> by this they are <hi>quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, ſtrengthned, comforted, guided;</hi> the Spirit that dwelt in them before, led them into dark and dangerous paths, gave them evil counſel; was always a provoking of them to be worſe and worſe; but here's one that will be checking and reproving of them, when they walk diſorderly, and that will be grieved at their ſins, and that will countenance and encourage them in way of duty, which is a great benefit.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Priviledg</hi> 9. This Freedom brings a <hi>right to all the Promiſes,</hi> Gal. 3. ult. And there is more riches in one Promiſe, than
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:64298:189"/> in a thouſand Worlds. I know not what portion ſome of you may deſire, or where you would have your lot to fall; if you could have your wiſh, very like you would deſire ſome huge things in this World, that you might have ſo great an eſtate as ſuch a man hath, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and then perhaps you would think, if it were but ſo, you had wiſhed your ſelves into a very good condition. But oh, beloved, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, the Promiſes, they are the Priviledges indeed; when you have them, you have God in Covenant with you: If you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider who 'tis that promiſes, and what 'tis that is promiſed, and the certainty that there cannot but be of the faithful and full performance of them, you muſt needs ſay, 'tis an high Priviledg to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſted in them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Priviledg</hi> 10. It brings <hi>Peace of conſcience,</hi> Rom 5. 1. Heb. 9. 14. This is ſuch a thing, that the having of it, is a kind of Heaven upon Earth, and the want of it is a kind of Hell upon Earth. If a mans conſcience fly in his Face, and the Sence of Guilt, and the Horror of ſpirit, ſeizes on him, let him enjoy the World if he can; 'twill bring down the ſtouteſt heart that is, to
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:64298:189"/> have but one ſound gripe of it; but theſe redeemed ones are in the way of Peace; Chriſt is to them the <hi>Prince of Peace,</hi> God is to them the <hi>God of Peace,</hi> the Word is to them the <hi>Word of Peace.</hi> When we come amongſt you in our preaching, and denounce the Wrath and Judgments of God; they are not theſe perſons that we mean, we have another meſſage for them; and we muſt in effect ſay to them in our Sermons, as <hi>Paul</hi> doth to them in the beginning of his Epiſtles, <hi>Grace be to you, and Peace, &amp;c.</hi> As a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> there were two Mountains, <hi>Gerizim</hi> and <hi>Eball,</hi> one to pronouce the bleſſings upon, and the other for the curſes; So beloved, tho when we would give you that are out of Chriſt, your portion, we muſt do that, as it were from the Mount of curſes; yet when we ſpeak to theſe, we muſt get up on the Mount of bleſſings.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Priviledg</hi> 11. Is <hi>Preſervance in holineſs.</hi> Hypocrites may fall away, becauſe they were never well on, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15. 7. there may come ſomething or other that will daſh their profeſſion to pieces; but theſe are well rooted, and nothing will be able to
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:64298:190"/> pluck them up; you ſhall not ſee them turn Saints in the beginning, and turn Devils in the end, as <hi>Judas</hi> did. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 6, you read that they had <hi>manifold tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;</hi> there were divers ways of ſuffering invented for them, to beat them off from Chriſt; and <hi>ver.</hi> 7. their faith was <hi>tried with fire;</hi> and yet it would <hi>be found unto praiſe, at the appearing of Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> and <hi>verſ.</hi> 9. for all that they went through, and ſhould receive the <hi>end of their faith, the ſalvation of their ſouls;</hi> they ſhould perſevere ſtill.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Priviledg</hi> 12. Is <hi>Acceſs to the Throne of Grace,</hi> Heb. 4. ult. Oh! what a Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg would it be counted upon Earth, that when the King is ſet down upon his Throne, tho he be in the poſture of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, to have free admiſſion to him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout a buſineſs of great concernment! You know how <hi>Eſther</hi> the Queen was afraid to come into the Kings preſence, and what a favour 'twas to her, when the King was upon his Throne, that he would reach out his golden Scepter to her, that ſhe might ſpeak freely, and ask what ſhe would, and it ſhould be given to her. But beloved, here's the Throne of the graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:64298:190"/> God may be come to, in and through Chriſt, by theſe redeemed ones. They may pour out their very hearts before him; and while they are a praying, he will be hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: he will <hi>bow down his ear, and attend to the voice of their cry.</hi> He will not bid them go out of his preſence; but they ſhall have audience in Heaven. And if the Lord ſees them afraid, or unable to utter their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires to him, his Spirit ſhall encourage them, and help their Infirmities.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Priviledg</hi> 13. Hence follows another Priviledg, That they ſhall have <hi>ſupply to all their wants.</hi> If God withhold any thing from them, to be ſure, tho it be good for others, yet 'tis not good for them in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, or not good for them at that time when they would have it: and ſo they have good reaſon, either to wait for it till it comes, or to be contented without it, if it ſhould not come at all. Now that this is their Priviledg, ſee <hi>Phil.</hi> 4. 19. <hi>But my God ſhall ſupply all your need, according to his riches in glory by Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> And God's children ſhould live as thoſe that believe this: And they ſhould be <hi>careful for nothing;</hi> and take no thought for their life, nor for their meat, nor their drink, nor their cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:64298:191"/> I don't ſay, you muſt not <hi>uſe means</hi> for theſe things. God doth not now pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for us, as he did for the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in the Wilderneſs, by <hi>raining down bread from Heaven.</hi> No: if you will <hi>eat,</hi> you muſt <hi>work:</hi> but you muſt work with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out perplexity; the Cares of the Wotld muſt not fret your hearts: If they do, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you do not belong to God, or you forget your Priviledg; which indeed is a very great one, That <hi>having given you his Son, he will with him alſo, freely give you all things,</hi> Rom. 8. 32.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Priviledg</hi> 14. They that are made free by Chriſt, are <hi>under ſpecial protection;</hi> as you know the children of Kings, and great Perſons, they muſt have ſome always with them, to ſee that they get no harm. So beloved, theſe perſons, they are well guarded: the Lord himſelf watches over them. 'Tis true, he doth employ Angels for their ſafety; and you'l ſay, that's a great matter, that Angels muſt wait on them, and be doing them all the good they can, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 91. 11. <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. <hi>ult.</hi> But God is ſo tender over them, that he will not truſt Angels alone with them, but he hath alſo committed them, the care of them, parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:64298:191"/> to his <hi>Son.</hi> Whereupon Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17. <hi>Thoſe whom theu haſt given me, I have kept:</hi> and yet he will look after them himſelf too: He is <hi>with</hi> them, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 41. 10. or he goes before them, and then he is behind them too, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 52. 12. and then on every ſide of them, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 125. 2. If this be not enough for their protection, then he will <hi>lead</hi> them, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 49. 10. if that be not enough, then he will <hi>cover</hi> them, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 91. 4. if that be not enough, then he will <hi>carry</hi> them, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 46. 4.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Priviledg</hi> 15. They are <hi>intereſted in the prayers of all the Saints in the World.</hi> It may be they are prayed for, ſome where or other, all the day long; yea, all the week; yea, all the year; yea, all their life: For it is like that there is a continual ſtock of Prayers a going, by ſome or other of them, night and day: And they don't uſe to pray for themſelves alone, but for others, and for their Fellow-Members moſt of all, as <hi>Paul</hi> did for the Churches of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Priviledg</hi> 16. Their Priviledges about their Afflictious are very great; as that they <hi>ſhall</hi> be, 1. <hi>moderated.</hi> God will not lift his Arm too high when he ſtrikes, nor make his Rod too big when he whips them, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 13. 2. <hi>Sweetned,</hi> Heb. 12. 6.
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:64298:192"/> 
                  <hi>For whom the Lord loveth he chaſteneth, and ſcourgeth every ſon whom he receiveth. Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth</hi>—and <hi>Son,</hi> theſe be words to ſwee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten his Corrections. 3. They ſhall be <hi>ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified;</hi> they ſhall be <hi>for our profit, ver.</hi> 10. There is either ſome Sin to purge out, or ſome Grace to be brightned, or increaſed, or ſome choice Experience to be learned. 4. At laſt <hi>removed.</hi> God will be ſure to hold his hand when 'tis enough, and to comfort them when they have mourned e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, and to take them out of the fire when they have been tried enough. He that hath redeemed <hi>Iſrael</hi> it ſelf, ſhall alſo <hi>redeem Iſrael out of all his troubles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Priviledg</hi> 17. They have <hi>acceptance of their poor ſincere duties.</hi> Alas! what is it that they do, or can do for the great God to take any notice of it? and yet God is well pleaſed with them, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 16. <hi>But to do good, and to communicate, forget not: for with ſuch ſacrifices God is well pleaſed.</hi> 1 Pet. 2. 5. <hi>Ye alſo, as lively ſtones, are built up a ſpiritual houſe, an holy prieſthood, to offer up ſpiritual ſacrifice acceptable to God by Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="363" facs="tcp:64298:192"/>
               <p> 
                  <hi>Priviledg</hi> 18. They ſhall be <hi>bleſſed in and after death: in</hi> their death, for they ſhall <hi>die in the Lord:</hi> and after death, for <hi>they ſhall be for ever with the Lord.</hi> As here they are brought into a Kingdom of Grace, ſo there they ſhall be brought into a Kingdom of Glory. Then comes the <hi>reſt,</hi> the <hi>inheritance,</hi> the <hi>pleaſures for evermore,</hi> the <hi>building of God, the houſe not made with hands, eternal in the heavens;</hi> the <hi>bleſſed hope,</hi> the <hi>everlaſting life.</hi> Much time might be ſpent about theſe Priviledges, and many others that might have been mentioned: But I ſhall ſtay no longer upon them. Now beloved, Is not this Freedom by Chriſt, an excellent thing upon this account too, namely, the excellent Priviledges which come by it? And truly now you have heard them, methinks you ſhould not be able to forbear going to God when you come home, pouring out your moſt earneſt cries to him in theſe words (with which I will cloſe up this <hi>5th</hi> Head), <hi>Pſal.</hi> 106. 4, 5. <hi>Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber me, O Lord, with the favour that thou bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt unto thy people: O viſit me with thy ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: That I may ſee the good of thy choſen: that I may rejoyce in the gladneſs of thy nation: that I may glory with thine inheritance.</hi>

                  <hi>Concerning the excellent <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſes that may be made of this Freedom.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THE Sixth way of making out the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of this Freedom by Chriſt, is to acquaint you with the <hi>excellent <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſes</hi> that may be made of it. The worth and value of any thing is ſeen in the Uſes to which it may be put. That which is of no uſe, is naught: that which is of ſome uſe, is good: that which is of great uſe, is very good: but that which is of the greateſt uſe, is beſt of all. Now beloved, to give this Freedom its due place, I muſt put it amongſt thoſe things which are of the higheſt uſe. and in doing ſo, I ſhall not ſet it one jot above what it deſerves: for the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt place doth of right belong to it. Now in ſpeaking upon this, I might ſhew,</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. <hi>The excellent <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſes which Chriſt makes of this Freedom.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <pb n="365" facs="tcp:64298:193"/>
                  <item> 2. <hi>The excellent <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſes which Chriſtians may make of it.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
               <p>I ſhall be brief upon the firſt, becauſe I do chiefly intend the latter.</p>
               <p>To the <hi>1ſt</hi> I will hint but Four excellent Uſes which <hi>Chriſt</hi> makes of it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. By this Freedom, he <hi>brings home all the elect of God:</hi> He fetches them one after another into the Kingdom of Grace and Glory. It was the will of God concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thoſe whom he hath choſen in the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal purpoſe of his love, that they ſhould be made holy in this World, and happy in the World to come. Now by this Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom Chriſt doth accompliſh that will of his Father: he brings them unto <hi>holineſs</hi> by it, <hi>Tit.</hi> 2. 14. and he brings them to <hi>hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs</hi> by it, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 10. So that this Freedom will diſcover who they are that are elected, and who are not: For they that are <hi>elected,</hi> will be <hi>ſanctified</hi> and <hi>glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified;</hi> and they that are not, will remain in their ſins, and be damned. It will ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate between the precious and the vile, between the <hi>Tares</hi> and the <hi>Wheat,</hi> between the <hi>Sheep</hi> and the <hi>Goats.</hi> By that time the work of this Freedom is finiſhed, it will
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:64298:194"/> ſet the children of God by themſelves, and the children of the Devil by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, that they ſhall never come near one another more, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25. 31, 32, 46.</p>
               <p n="2">2. By this Freedom Chriſt <hi>repairs the great breach by the Fall of mankind.</hi> He heals that deadly wound, and makes up that unſpeakable loſs for as many as believe on his Name. In that Apoſtacy from God, the Devil did a World of miſchief to the Sons of Men: but by this Freedom Chriſt undermines him, and out-plots him; and he brings his whole deſign againſt the Elect of God to nothing: and thereof you read, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3, 8. that Chriſt was manifeſted for this purpoſe, that he might <hi>destroy his works.</hi> The Devil was hard at work when he brought in the Fall, and all the ſin and miſery that followed upon it. He never wrought harder in his life, than he did at this time, and at one more, and that was when Jeſus Chriſt was in the World, and now come in perſon to reſtore liberty by the Goſpel; Then he wrought ſo hard to withſtand the ſalvation of ſinners by Chriſt, that I may ſay, after our manner of expreſſing things, he ſweat till he dropt again: He was, as it were, all of a foam
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:64298:194"/> with rage: And he ſhewed it ſufficiently from the very Birth, to the very Death of Chriſt. And 'tis obſervable for this, what Chriſt ſaith in <hi>Luke</hi> 22. 53. when <hi>Judas</hi> and his company were come to take him, that that time was the <hi>power</hi> of Darkneſs; <hi>i. e:</hi> Satan was then at work with all his might. But to look back again to the Fall, Oh, how he was at work there! And when he had prevailed with our firſt Parents in the Temptation, no doubt but he thought that he had made ſtrong and ſure work of it; that all was now his own for ever: for he knew that man could never recover him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: and he knew that all the Angels in Heaven were not able to do it: and he knew, that tho God in mercy could have pardoned them, yet that muſt not be nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, without ſatisfaction to his Juſtice: and he little thought of any ſuch way to be taken, as for God to ſend his only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten Son into the World, that the World through him might be ſaved, tho it was not long after, but he had an incling of it, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 15. Now Chriſt by this Freedom, cruſhes and breaks the Devil's head; <hi>i. e.</hi> ſpoils all the Maſter-peice of his malice and ſubtilty; reſtores that Image of God of which he had robb'd us; brings in a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:64298:195"/> of Grace for a Covenant of Works broken; and begins the World a-new, as it were.</p>
               <p n="3">3. By this Freedom, Chriſt <hi>executes the three great Offices of a Prophet, Prieſt,</hi> and <hi>King.</hi> God the Father appointed and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed him to all theſe Offices, and by this redeeming-work he does diſcharge them. His Office of a Prophet, is to teach his Church the things that are needful to their Salvation; by this Freedom he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charges that; therefore <hi>Joh.</hi> 15. 13. with <hi>verſ.</hi> 15. when he tells them that he had ſhewed his great love to them in <hi>laying down his life for them,</hi> that is, to make them free; he adds this, that he had made <hi>known all things to them, which he had heard of his Father,</hi> that is, which his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had ſent him to teach them in, for their ſpiritual and eternal good. His Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of a <hi>Prieſt,</hi> was to ſuffer and ſatisfie for them upon Earth, and to intercede for them in Heaven, and by this Freedom he diſcharges that, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 17. His Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of a King, is to rule in his Church by way of increaſing, preſerving, defending, and ordering of it, and by this Freedom he diſcharges that; as in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 9. 6, 7. you may ſee. So that all that Chriſt doth, it
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:64298:195"/> relates to this Freedom; either 'tis in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to the giving of it, or elſe 'tis the fruit and effect of his having given it; we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not name any thing that ever he did, or yet doth, or ſhall do as Mediator, but it ſome way or other runs into this.</p>
               <p n="4">4. By this Freedom <hi>Chriſt leaves matter of the higheſt Condemnation upon the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſers of the Goſpel.</hi> Sirs, I beſeech you conſider this, The Lord Jeſus is reſolved to make uſe of this Freedom one way or other, with all of you, either to ſave or damn you: Where he can't make the <hi>one</hi> uſe, that is to <hi>ſave</hi> ſinners, he will make the <hi>other</hi> uſe of it, that is to <hi>ſink</hi> ſinners. Where it doth not ſerve as an Engine to raiſe them, 'twill ſerve as an Engine to ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in them. Doubt not of it, Chriſt will have enough to ſay from this ſalvation of his, when he hath offered it, and you have deſpiſed it, to leave you without excuſe. 'Twill furniſh him abundantly with Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to plead againſt you, that will ſtop all your mouths at the laſt day; when he ſhall tell you, how he had prepared a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy that would have delivered you from all your miſery, and how he did moſt wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly ſhed that precious blood of his, which would have waſhed away all your
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:64298:196"/> ſins: and if you had but come to him, you might have been as ſafe, and as bleſſed as others that believed in him: but nothing would prevail with you to bring you in: You either did not look after him at all, or if you did, it was not to purpoſe: You could not find in your hearts to turn every ſin out of doors: there muſt be ſomething of your Luſts that muſt be ſpared, and ſomething of his Terms that muſt be abated: You were afraid of buying Chriſt too dear. Well now, what ſhall Chriſt do, but make uſe of this Freedom and Goſpel for a Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs againſt you? and be ſure of it, he is reſolved to do it. That place doth inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate ſo much to you before-hand, in <hi>John</hi> 3. 18, 19. But I ſhall ſay no more of the Uſes which Chriſt makes of this Freedom; but ſhall come to ſhew the excellent Uſes that Chriſtians may make of it.</p>
               <p>And in reference to them, I ſhall lay down in Twelve things, <hi>what this Freedom is good for.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. To make them from their hearts to <hi>pity Chriſtleſs perſons:</hi> To do that in ſome meaſure which you read of Chriſt, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> which <hi>did not know the</hi>
                  <pb n="371" facs="tcp:64298:196"/> 
                  <hi>things of their peace in the day of their viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation;</hi> when he came near the City, he <hi>beheld it, and wept over it.</hi> So, beloved, this Freedom is good to make them that have it, to <hi>weep</hi> over them that have it not; and to ſay, Ah poor ſinners! ah precious ſouls! where are you? what will become of you? It will preſent unconverted men and women, to the mind and thoughts of a Believer in Chriſt, as the ſaddeſt ſpecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles that ever their eyes beheld. Their Freedom now, makes them ſenſible what 'tis to be a ſinner. While they were in the Bondage themſelves, they ſaw not the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger that was in that condition; but now they do: and ſo they are prepared to pity every one that is left behind. Indeed they ſee (and 'tis commonly to be ſeen) that theſe Chriſtleſs perſons are ſecure and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, as if all were as well as could be. But all this makes thoſe that have this Freedom, to pity them the more. It would be ſome comfort to them, to ſee them ſtruck down with Convictions, that things are not well within them; and to hear them cry out as the Jaylor did to <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas, Sirs, what muſt I do to be ſaved?</hi> &amp;c. But to ſee them in their ſins, and yet to be <hi>ſecure;</hi> to ſee them under the Curſe, and yet to
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:64298:197"/> be <hi>merry,</hi> Oh! this ſets their hearts a bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Now take ſome Scriptures where you ſhall ſee that this Freedom is good for this excellent uſe and purpoſe; ſee <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 158. alſo <hi>ver.</hi> 136. <hi>Rivers of waters run down mine eyes; becauſe they keep not thy law. Obj.</hi> But you'l ſay, this is the <hi>Old Teſtament. Anſ.</hi> What tho it be? the Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom was in force then, and <hi>David</hi> was a partaker of it. But would you have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing out of the <hi>New Teſtament</hi> for it? ſee then <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 18. <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 1, 2, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> where you find, that <hi>Paul,</hi> who was in this Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, had tears in his eyes, and heart-breaking grief within him, for thoſe that went Chriſtleſs. And beloved, this Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom will teach Miniſters that have it, to pity their Chriſtleſs Hearers; and Parents that have it, to pity their Chriſtleſs Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; and Maſters that have it, to pity their Chriſtleſs Servants, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And is not this an excellent uſe now? I dare ſay, you can't be in this Freedom, any of you, but your bowels and compaſſion will work in ſome meaſure, inſad be moaning the wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed condition of perſons in a ſtate of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="373" facs="tcp:64298:197"/> 2. It is good to make us <hi>underſtand the Goſpel.</hi> This Freedom ſets up a light to ſhew us what that is. Friends, this word <hi>Goſpel,</hi> is a Myſterious word, and carries ſuch things in at, as no natural man can receive or percieve, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 14. Now, oh, what an excellent thing would it be to underſtand thoſe things which all the wiſdom of the men of this World, (who un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand abundance upon other accounts) is not able to tell what to make of! Why, now come into this Freedom, and the mind and the Myſteries of God will be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folded to you; you will be brought out of darkneſs into the marvellous light; Chriſt and the Covenant of Grace will be revealed to you; <hi>you ſhall know the truth, and the truth ſhall make you free,</hi> verſ. 32. of this <hi>8th</hi> of <hi>John.</hi> As <hi>Luther</hi> ſaid when he was brought to the knowledg of Chriſt, and of juſtification by faith, that <hi>the whole Scripture ſeemed to be a new thing to him;</hi> he ſaw that in it which he never ſaw before: ſo 'twill be with you. What's the reaſon that perſons are ſo ignorant of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly things, as they are, of the new Birth, of the Life of Faith, of Communion with Chriſt, but becauſe they are not brought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this Freedom? Certainly this would make
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:64298:198"/> the Bible another manner of thing to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of you, than ever 'twas yet. Oh, the inſight that thoſe get into the Wiſdom and Grace of God, who are brought into this liberty, of that they had before! Now they can ſpeak of Salvation by the Son of God, and the things which belong to it, like knowing men; this Freedom hath o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened the eyes of their underſtanding. Beloved, what <hi>Sampſon</hi> ſaid to the <hi>Phili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtines,</hi> when he had propounded a riddle to them, the meaning of which they were not able to pick out, but by the help of his Wife; Judg. 14. 18. <hi>If,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>ye had not plowed with my heifer, ye had not found out my riddle;</hi> the ſame I may ſay, of the Myſteries of the Kingdom of God; you'l never diſcern them, if you don't make uſe of Chriſts Freedom; for they are like the Book, <hi>Rev.</hi> 5. which was <hi>ſealed with ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven ſeals,</hi> and none was able to open it, or to look thereon with any under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, till Chriſt had opened the Seals thereof. In <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 7. the Apoſtle-ſpeaks, that they had gotten this Freedom by Chriſt; and then in <hi>verſ.</hi> 9. he brings in this, <hi>Having made known to us, the Myſtery of his will; then</hi> they came to know it.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="375" facs="tcp:64298:198"/> 3. Another excellent uſe of this Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom is this: It is good to <hi>endear Chriſt to the Soul:</hi> Alas, what is Chriſt to thoſe, who remain in the Bondage of ſin? What beauty do they ſee in him? What brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>things have they after him? You were even as good tell them of a chip, as tell them of Chriſt, for any regard they have to him; there's nothing that is of leſs account or eſteem with them, than he is. He is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led there, in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 49. 7. one <hi>whom man de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſeth,</hi> and <hi>whom the nation,</hi> (i. e. of the <hi>Jews) did abhor.</hi> What two greater words for undervaluing of Chriſt, can you meet with, than to <hi>deſpiſe</hi> him, and <hi>abhor</hi> him? But now the having of this Freedom, oh, 'twill make Chriſt a precious Chriſt to the Soul, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 7. they can't but prize him, who have been redeemed by him, when they conſider what he hath done for them; that he came down from Heaven for <hi>them,</hi> and became poor for <hi>their</hi> ſakes, and that he was mocked and ſcourged, and ſpit upon for <hi>them,</hi> and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Croſs for <hi>them,</hi> and bear the Wrath and Curſe of God for <hi>them:</hi> Oh how doth this make them to be highly in love with him! and to wiſh that they had a thouſand times more love for him, then they
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:64298:199"/> have. And certainly, you that believe in Chriſt, this is one great means to raiſe up your love to him; when you do find or fear that your Affection to him begins to be chilled, to ſet your ſelves to meditate upon the Freedom that he hath given you, and how abundantly he hath ſhewed his dear Love to you, in dying for you, and in waſhing of you in his own Blood; ply your hearts a while, as hard as you can, with deep and ſerious thought about this; I am perſwaded 'twill prove a love-kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and a love inflaming conſideration to you; you will find that you have af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, and dear affections, for Chriſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.</p>
               <p n="4">4. It is good to make <hi>all ones life com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable.</hi> As the being without this Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, is the way to make all ones life mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable; ſo the having of it, and the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that one hath it, laies in matter of daily conſolation. Let whatever will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall a man, this will be always at hand to cheer him; there is no cordial to the heart like it, when a man can look upon his troubles, and ſay, Notwithſtanding 'tis thus and thus with me, yet, bleſſed be God, he hath had mercy on me. I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to Chriſt, and what can hurt me?
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:64298:199"/> You would not much fear living comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, if you had but two things in your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort. 1. That it were ſo ſtrong, that nothing could overcome it. And 2. That it ſhould be ſo laſting, that it would never have an end. Why now, ſuch comfort this Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom brings, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 18. and 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2. 1. in the one place 'tis called <hi>ſtrong</hi> Conſolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and in the other <hi>everlaſting</hi> Conſolation. And therefore away with that vile re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, which ſome are apt to caſt upon the condition of Gods people, that 'tis <hi>a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy life;</hi> as if perſons muſt never look to be merry more in this World, after they are once turned <hi>Godly;</hi> the Devil hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ſomething or other to blind and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fool ſinners, and to make them think that <hi>their</hi> condition is the merry condition, and the Saints condition the mopiſh con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition; but if ever he were a liar, he is a liar in this; and God will judg him and his inſtruments for bringing up this evil report upon the good Land which he hath given his people. Beloved, be not diſcouraged by this ſlander, from looking after this heavenly <hi>Canaan,</hi> as the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were from entring into the earthly <hi>Canaan,</hi> when the Spies that went to ſearch the land had ſpoken evil of it to
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:64298:200"/> them; for as <hi>Caleb</hi> ſaid to them, the ſame I ſay to you, The Land is an exceeding good Land; I mean now, the ſtate into which Chriſt hath brought believers, is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in <hi>this World</hi> a joyful ſtate. You ſhall ſee how it was prophecied of, in the <hi>Old Teſtament,</hi> that it ſhould be ſo, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 67. read <hi>verſ.</hi> 1, 2. where he ſpeaks of the coming of this Freedom. <hi>God be merciful unto us, and bleſs us, and cauſe his face to ſhine upon us. Selah. That thy way may be known upon earth, thy ſaving health among all nations;</hi> and what follows, why <hi>verſ.</hi> 3, 4, 5. <hi>Let the people praiſe thee, O God: let all the people praiſe thee: O let the nations be glad and ſing for joy;</hi> there's the joy that it brings with it. So <hi>Iſa.</hi> 35. 10. this chapter is to he underſtood of Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel Freedom and Salvation; and mark what Joy here is now. <hi>The ranſomed of the Lord ſhall return, and come to Zion with ſongs, and everlaſting joy upon their heads: they ſhall obtain joy and gladneſs, and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row and ſighing ſhall flee away. Obj.</hi> But where can you ſhew us the people in the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> that live ſo comfortably and joyfully by this Freedom, and that in this World? Why, turn to Rom. 5. 2. <hi>By whom alſo we have acceſs by faith into this</hi>
                  <pb n="379" facs="tcp:64298:200"/> 
                  <hi>grace wherein we ſtand, and rejoyce in hope of the glory of God;</hi> and verſ. 10, 11. <hi>For if when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son: much more being reconciled, we ſhall be ſaved by his life. And not only ſo, but we alſo joy in God, through our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, by whom we have received the attenement. Obj.</hi> But it may be they were a people that met with no great afflictions; if they had, it would have ſpoiled their joy, tho they were in this Freedom. Well, for that I'll give you a full Scripture, ſee 1 Pet. 1. Theſe were <hi>ſcattered abroad by perſecution,</hi> verſ. 1. They had <hi>manifold temptations,</hi> verſ. 6. And in v. 7. the Apoſtle ſpeaks of the tryal of their Faith <hi>by fire:</hi> Yet in <hi>verſ.</hi> 8. how comfortable they were for all this, <hi>In whom tho now ye ſee him not, yet believing, ye re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce with joy unſpeakable and full of glory.</hi> Sirs, you that are out of this Freedom; are hindred by it from abundance of joy; you don't know what true joy and true comfort is, without it.</p>
               <p n="5">5. It is good to make us <hi>taſte the ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that is in the ways of God;</hi> 'twas the Spouſe of Chriſt, the redeemed company, that uttered that in <hi>Cant.</hi> 2. 3. <hi>I ſat down under his ſhadow with great delight, and</hi>
                  <pb n="380" facs="tcp:64298:201"/> 
                  <hi>his fruit was ſweet to my taſte:</hi> Duties, Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances are ſapleſs things without this, but they are refreſhing, yea, raviſhing things with it. What made <hi>David</hi> ſay, that a <hi>day in Gods Courts, was better than a thouſand otherwhere?</hi> 'twas becauſe he was in this <hi>Freedom.</hi> Why did the Lord call his Ordinances that ſhould be under the Goſpel, <hi>A feaſt of fat things, a feaſt of wine on the lees, of fat things full of marrow, of wine on the lees well fined,</hi> Iſa. 25. 6. But, becauſe he knew they would be ſo to Souls that ſhould be brought into this Freedom. Oh, this is that which will make a <hi>Prayer</hi> ſweet, and a good <hi>Sermon</hi> ſweet, and a <hi>Sacrament</hi> ſweet, and <hi>Grace</hi> and the <hi>Exerciſe</hi> of it ſweet. You that are in the Bondage of ſins, may come and hear precious truths, but you cannot tell what is in them, for ſavour and reliſh; that Bondage hath put your mouths quite out of taſte, as I may ſay to you; there's no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſo ſweet, as that which is moſt bitter, and that is ſin; if your palat were not viti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated by this Bondage, you would call it, as the Scripture calls it, viz. <hi>The gall of bitterneſs, and the bond of iniquity,</hi> Acts 8. 23.</p>
               <p n="6">
                  <pb n="381" facs="tcp:64298:201"/> 6. This Freedom is good to make us <hi>ſpiritually uſeful.</hi> Indeed one that hath it not, may be uſeful, and very uſeful for earthly reſpects; and if he ſhould be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away by death, there might be a great miſs of him; the family might want him, or the Pariſh may want him: But ſpiritually uſeful ſuch a one is not, nor can be, any otherwiſe then as a wooden leg can be uſeful to the body, which tho it helps it a little, yet 'tis but outwardly, it hath none of that life or motion that the true members have. But now, they whom Chriſt hath made free, oh, what a deal they are good for, upon a ſpiritual ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count; they are uſeful perſons to bring up a Family for God, they are good for the <hi>Souls</hi> of their Relations. You that are out of Chriſt, you may be good for the bodies of your Children; you may be good to provide them Meat, and Drink, and Cloaths, and to take care of them, when any of them fall ſink, that they may not want attendance, or the like; or you may be good to train them up in a civil way, and to lay up for them, what you can, for a Portion in this World, or to put them to a good Trade, or help them to as rich a match as you can, and in theſe kind of
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:64298:202"/> things your uſefulneſs to them, is at its journeys end. As for the poor Souls of your Children; you forget them, becauſe you never rememberd your own; it may be you'l ſay to your Children ſometimes, <hi>you muſt be a good boy, or a good girl,</hi> and there's all the good counſel that they ſhall have of you; but alas, you take no care to tell them which way they muſt be good indeed; and truly, if God ſhould take you away from them, and leave them Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therleſs and Motherleſs, their outward man would miſs you ſadly, it may be; but their Souls would not; you were never good for them; but they who are in this Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom are good for the Souls of their Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. And beloved, they are very uſeful per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to promote a good work, when they ſee it would tend much to the Glory of God, to have it carried on, and to take oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions and opportunities of ſpeaking to others about everlaſting concernments; and to mourn for the ſins of the times and places in which they live, and to ſtand in the gap when the Wrath of God is break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in upon a Nation; and when God takes away one of theſe, oh, what a miſs there is of them, and what a loſs 'tis upon the beſt account! If God had pleaſed, a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:64298:202"/> wicked men might have been better ſpared than one of theſe. The leaſt of theſe is ſo uſeful, that the greateſt in Grace can't ſay, they have no need of him, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 21. and mark what 'tis ſaid of <hi>Oneſinus, Phil.</hi> verſ. 10. <hi>Whom I have begotten in my bonds;</hi> that is, Chriſt hath now given him his Freedom, by uſing me as an inſtrument for his converſion. Well, what then? Why verſ. 11. <hi>Which in time paſt was to thee unprofitable: but now profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to thee and to me.</hi> Now he becomes a profitable man.</p>
               <p n="7">7. It is good, again, to <hi>knit our hearts in love to all the people of God.</hi> Oh! how dear will the Saints be to us, when we ſee that we are delivered from the power of darkneſs, and that God hath tranſlated us into the Kingdom of his dear Son! When we can ſay to them, Now bleſſed be the Lord, I am one of you, I am a partaker of your Grace, and have obtained like precious Faith with you; that Blood which hath waſhed you, hath waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me; that righteouſneſs of Chriſt which covers your unrighteouſneſs, covers mine alſo: For if one finds it ſo, one may to the Glory of God tell them ſo, as <hi>Paul</hi> did to the Galatians chap. 2. 20. That <hi>Chriſt had lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:64298:203"/> him, and given himſelf for him.</hi> This now will ſo joyn our affections to the Saints (at leaſt it will be the way to it), that our Souls will as it were <hi>cleave</hi> to their Souls; 'twill not only joyn hand to hand, but <hi>Soul to Soul.</hi> That's a notable place, Acts 4. 32. <hi>And the multitude of them that believed, were of one heart, and of one ſoul,</hi> &amp;c. When once they were got into this Freedom together, (which is included in the word <hi>believed.)</hi> Oh what a love here was to one another! This is an uniting Freedom, not only to Chriſt, as you have heard, but to all his members.</p>
               <p n="8">8. It good is to <hi>ſtrengthen our Faith</hi> in the greateſt ſtraits. For by this Freedom a Child of God may reaſon thus; Why, he that brought me out of that dreadful mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery of my ſinful condition, that did ſo great a work as <hi>that,</hi> and gave me ſo great a deliverance as <hi>that,</hi> can bring me out of this. I cannot come into ſuch a woful condition again, as that was, let befall me what will for affliction or trouble; 'tis not like my ſpiritual Bondage that I was in, while out of Chriſt; and yet, through infinite mercy I am freed from it; and did God remember me there, and ſhall he not remember me here? <hi>David,</hi> when he prays
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:64298:203"/> for deliverance out of his preſent diſtreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, thinks of this, that God hath redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him; ſo you may fetch a mighty ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port <hi>from your redemption</hi> by Chriſt, for your weak Faith, when great Tryals are upon you; what, do you think that God will let you periſh in them, and he hath <hi>redeemed</hi> you? why, which is more, to deliver thee out of the hand of the <hi>Devil,</hi> and out of the hand of Gods <hi>Juſtice,</hi> and from the <hi>Wrath to come;</hi> or to deliver thee out of ſome <hi>light Afflictions</hi> in this World?</p>
               <p n="9">9. It is good to <hi>make you rich.</hi> Oh! how do many deſire to be rich? Now this is the way to make you,</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) <hi>Really</hi> rich; not to ſeem to be rich, and yet be poor, as ſome do; but rich <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed:</hi> So rich that you ſhall have treaſures, <hi>In the houſe of the rightouſneſs, is much trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure;</hi> 'tis becauſe he hath this Freedom; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed this Freedom is his treaſure, as 'tis ſaid, <hi>Prov.</hi> 13. 8. <hi>The ranſom of a mans life are his riches;</hi> 'tis true here.</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) <hi>Inwarldly</hi> rich; rich towards God in Grace, and things of a ſpiritual nature. <hi>Obj.</hi> But I would fain have ſomething, if pleaſe God, of this World too. <hi>Anſ.</hi> Why
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:64298:204"/> this Freedom is the way to that too, <hi>God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs hath the promiſe of the life that now is,</hi> 1 Tim. 4. 8. <hi>Obj.</hi> But they who have this Freedoms, are generally the poorer ſort, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 27. <hi>Not many mighty, not many noble, are called. Anſ.</hi> 1. They are not all ſo then, as you ſee there. 2. God doth that for them, tho they be poor, which is equivalent to great riches, even in this World. For 1. He ſupplies them ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times by <hi>ſpecial Providence:</hi> God ſtirs up the hearts of others to do them good. There were poor Saints at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> that had not of their own; but the Lord pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for them, by putting it into the hearts of others, that were able, to make a Collection for them, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15. 26. So <hi>Paul,</hi> tho he had not of his own, yet the <hi>Philippians</hi> ſent once and again to his ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, <hi>cap.</hi> 4. 16. and that ſupplied him ſo in his preſent wants, that he looked up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on himſelf as a rich man, <hi>verſ.</hi> 18. 2. What is wanting in abundance, God makes up in <hi>contentment, verſ.</hi> 11, 12. of that <hi>chap.</hi> and this is equivalent to a great Eſtate; nay, there be many that have great Eſtates, and yet are not contented. Now, pray who is the rich man, he that hath but a little, and yet is contented,
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:64298:204"/> or he that hath a great deal, and yet is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented? 3. God gives his <hi>bleſſing</hi> with that little they have, and the <hi>bleſſing of the Lord maketh rich,</hi> Prov. 10. 22. 'tis not ſo much what a man hath, as what God bleſſes to him. A great Eſtate <hi>without</hi> that, will prove cankered and wormeaten; and with that, leſs by far will do the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs.</p>
               <p n="3">(3.) This Freedom is good to make you <hi>eternally</hi> rich; there be many that are very rich in this World, and yet will be miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly poor in the World to come, becauſe they never had this Freedom by Chriſt. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, people uſe to ſay, when a man hath a great Eſtate, that he is <hi>made;</hi> yea, but for how long? 'tis but, at moſt, for this life. If he be not in Chriſt, there's that a coming, that will <hi>unmake</hi> him again; but he that is ſo, is <hi>made for ever,</hi> Prov. 8. 21. <hi>That I may cauſe thoſe that love me, to inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit ſubſtance; and I will fill their treaſures. Subſtance</hi> and <hi>Treaſures,</hi> there's their riches; yea, but then ſaith he, I'll cauſe them to <hi>inherit</hi> it too, <hi>i. e.</hi> I will <hi>make</hi> them for ever.</p>
               <p n="10">10. This Freedom is of excellent uſe to <hi>keep Chriſtians humble;</hi> it greatly becomes
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:64298:205"/> the people of God, to have low thoughts of themſelves; of all Chriſtians, the hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Chriſtian is the moſt lovely Chriſtian. If I ſee a man, tho I hope, and believe he hath grace; yet if he be not humble, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks he is not half ſo beautiful in his walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Whatever good thing one hath in him beſides, yet to have the heart to be lifted up, 'tis even like the dropping of a great blot of Ink upon fair writing: How fair would the ſtory of good <hi>Hezekiahs</hi> Life and Reign have been, of whom you read ſo many excellent things, all along the 2 <hi>Chron. cap.</hi> 29. and 30. and 31. and 32. had it not been for that one great blot, which you meet with in <hi>verſ.</hi> 25. of <hi>chap.</hi> 32. Beloved, the Grace of Humility is the Glory of ones Graces. Well, but then, what is good to make us, and keep us hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble? Oh, nothing like this Freedom by Chriſt. If we do but make uſe of it, as we might, it would lay us as low as the ground, yea, as low as Hell in our own thoughts; for thus a Child of God may reaſon with himſelf: By this Freedom I have great Priviledges; and I may ſay of Gods kindneſs to my Soul in his Son, as <hi>David</hi> did concerning Gods making a Covenant with him, 1 Cor. 17. 17. <hi>Thou</hi>
                  <pb n="389" facs="tcp:64298:205"/> 
                  <hi>haſt regarded me according to the eſtate of a man of high degree, O Lord God.</hi> And now in compariſon of theſe heavenly riches and hopes, which I have beſtowed upon me, I contemn all the World, and count all things, as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid, <hi>but loſs and dung.</hi> I, but 'tis all by Grace, not for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny deſert of mine; was I <hi>worthy</hi> that God ſhould do this for me? Is not this the richeſt alms that ever was, to the pooreſt beggar that ever was? I am arrayed in a coſty Robe, (for the righteouſneſs of Chriſt is ſo); but where had I this good cloathing? I am freed from Condemnation, but who diſcharged me? I ſee, but who opened mine eyes? I am a King to God, but who gave me my ſpiritual Crown? Is it not of free Grace? And if God ſhould take away his free Grace, what ſhould I have left? Well therefore, how humble muſt I be, as well as how thankful? And if I may ſay, as <hi>David</hi> did in the words before mentioned, in <hi>verſ.</hi> 17. Have I not cauſe alſo to ſay as <hi>David</hi> did by way of ſelf-abaſement, verſ. 6. <hi>Who am I, O Lord God, and what is mine houſe, that thou haſt brought me hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto?</hi> Oh, this Freedom by Chriſt is a good weapon to run into the very heart of ſpiritual Pride; to ſhut it out of doors.
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:64298:206"/> In <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 24, 25, 26. where the Apoſtle is ſpeaking of it, that it comes <hi>freely,</hi> and brings with it <hi>remiſſion of ſins, and juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation through faith</hi> in the righteouſneſs of Chriſt; you ſhall ſee he adds this in verſ. 27. <hi>Where is boaſting then? it is excluded. By what law? of works? Nay: but by the law of faith.</hi> As if he ſhould ſay, Oh, what Doctrine is this Doctrine, of redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by Chriſt, to lay us all low!</p>
               <p n="11">11. This Freedom is of excellent uſe, to <hi>engage us to Chriſt in the ſtricteſt obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</hi> As it was the <hi>cord of Love,</hi> to draw us <hi>to him</hi> at firſt: So it is the <hi>Bond of Love,</hi> to keep us <hi>with him.</hi> And this is the great deſign of <hi>Paul</hi> throughout his Epiſtles to the Churches, to ſhew how the Grace of the Goſpel, doth oblige them to a holy Converſation in all things, and to bring forth fruit unto God. One would think, beloved, that the conſideration of this Freedom, if we have a part in it, ſhould keep us from everſitting looſe from Chriſt more; but that we have ſuch naughty hearts, that almoſt nothing is ſtrong enough to hold us in. Surely, there is much in it, to ſtir up a Chriſtian to all that is good. Oh! if one did but feel the Power of this Freedom upon ones heart, what a life
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:64298:206"/> ſhould one lead! What a frame ſhould one be in? How would it <hi>water</hi> our Grace, and cauſe our ſins to wither? See for this that Scripture, 2 Cor. 5. 14, 15. <hi>For the love of Chriſt conſtraineth us, becauſe we thus judg, that if one died for all, then were all dead: And that he died for all, that they which live, ſhould not henceforth live unto themſelves, but unto him which died for them, and roſe again.</hi> Mark that word <hi>conſtraineth.</hi> As if he ſhould ſay, we muſt <hi>needs</hi> be holy when we think of this Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; it ſo ſhuts up in the narrow way which leadeth to Life, that we cannot get out. Tho our carnal part would fain have <hi>its</hi> liberty; yet this liberty by Chriſt will not permit it. Indeed, holineſs and cloſe walking with God, is the great Leſſon which this Freedom teacheth, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 11, 12. and without this, we don't <hi>uſe, but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe</hi> our Freedom. And therefore, what the Apoſtle ſaid to them, in <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 13. is very fit to be minded here: <hi>For brethren, ye have been called unto liberty; only uſe not your liberty for an occaſion to the fleſh.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved, if ye be not very watchful, the fleſh will take an occaſion from the good condition which Chriſt hath brought you into; to inſinuate it ſelf, and draw you
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:64298:207"/> into remiſneſs in good things: As if ſince there is ſuch abundance of grace revealed, there need not be altogether ſuch circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection in every thing you do; but what he ſaith there to them, in <hi>verſ.</hi> 8. I ſay to you, <hi>This perſwaſion cometh not of him that calleth you.</hi> This Freedom will not allow you any ſin, for Chriſt gave himſelf for you, that he might redeem you from all iniquity; and 'tis the <hi>Law of your Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi> That you muſt live to him that freed you, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 20. and if you be freed by him, ſo you will, Rom. 6. 18. <hi>Being then made free from ſin, ye became the ſervants righteouſneſs.</hi> Verſ. 22. <hi>But now being made free from ſin, and become ſervants to God, ye have your fruit unto holineſs, and the end everlaſting life.</hi> And remember this, that if a perſon can hear never ſo much, or think never ſo much, or profeſſes never ſo much, or know never ſo much of this Redemption by Chriſt, and it be not a <hi>purifying</hi> thing to him, he is not a parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker of it.</p>
               <p n="12">12. Laſtly, This Freedom is of excellent uſe to <hi>fit us for Death.</hi> Beloved, we muſt all dye, and therefore we ſhould all labour to be fit to dye: 'Tis a bleſſed thing to be fit for death; for if we be fit to dye, we
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:64298:207"/> are fit to live; nay, if we be fit for Death, we are fit for Judgment, and fit for Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. Now the queſtion is, How one ſhould be fit to dye? Why certainly, you can take no way to be fit for it, but by get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting into this Freedom by Chriſt. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs a man is not preſently fit for death, by the having of it; therefore there is ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily ſomething that muſt be between Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion and Salvation; therefore there muſt be a growing up, and a ripening by further degrees of Sanctification; but yet upon the very entrance into this Freedom there's the foundation of a fitneſs for death laid; and if ſuch a perſon ſhould dye preſently, he would be happy for ever. But you that are out of Chriſt, you are not in the leaſt forwardneſs for death; there's nothing at all done towards it; and therefore, if God ſhould but ſtop your breath (as you don't know how ſoon he may), you'l be found altogether unprepared, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting miſery will be your portion. But now the people of God, tho they have not all as yet that is requiſite to make them fully ready to be gone out of the World: Yet by their very <hi>being</hi> in the ſtate of this Freedom, they are ſo fit for Death, as that their Death ſhall be
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:64298:208"/> in mercy to them, let it come never ſo ſoon; and they are ſo fit for Heaven, as that to be ſure they ſhall not miſs of it, <hi>Col</hi> 1. 12, 13, 14.</p>
               <p>And ſo, now you ſee what excellent Uſes may be made of this Freedom, and thereupon what an excellent Freedom this muſt needs be. Now you that are in it, I beſeech you, put your Freedom to theſe good Uſes which I have ſet before you; let it teach you to pitty poor ſinners to get more underſtanding in the Goſpel; let it endear Chriſt to you, let it comfort your hearts, let it make the ways of God ſweet to you, and you uſeful. Prize the Saints, let it ſtrengthen your faith; be enriched by it in all goodneſs; let it make you very humble, and engage you to Chriſt in the ſtricteſt obedience, and to be ready againſt your Lord ſhall come.</p>

               </head>
               <p>THE Seventh and Laſt thing, to ſet out the excellency of this Freedom, is to ſpeak ſomething of the <hi>many Wonders</hi> that may be obſerved in it. Beloved, if ever there were any thing to be wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at, ſince the beginning of the World, this Freedom is to be wondered at; there's enough in it to amaze and aſtoniſh eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry beholder: You know people are migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily taken with ſeeing of rare ſights, and the hearing of ſtrange news; but never did any thing preſent you with ſuch rare ſights, nor bring ſuch ſtrange news to your ears, as this Freedom doth. The whole ſtory of it is wonderful from firſt to laſt; it begins in Wonders, and goes on in Wonders, and is finiſhed in Wonders. The Freedom that God gave his people from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Bondages, for their worldly condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, were attended and accompanied with great Wonders; ſo 'twas when he brought

But now this ſame ſpiritual Freedom, is the <hi>Wonder of Wonders.</hi> I might obſerve to you, how that in many places of the Scripture, where this Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom is ſpoken of, 'tis brought in with this word <hi>behold,</hi> that's put before it, as who ſhould ſay, do you mind what a <hi>Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> here is? Can you paſs it by without admiration? ſee it in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 7. 14. <hi>chap.</hi> 28. 16. <hi>chap.</hi> 42. 1. <hi>Jer.</hi> 23. 5, 6. <hi>Zech.</hi> 9. 9. <hi>Luk.</hi> 2. 10. <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 29. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 1. and in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 9. 6. When Chriſt is prophecied of that he ſhould come into the World for
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:64298:209"/> the giving of this Freedom, amongſt all his other names, this is one, and the firſt that is mentioned, that he ſhould be <hi>won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful.</hi> But now, to come to Particulars, If I ſhould inſiſt upon all the Wonders be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to this Freedom, I ſhould be too large; and indeed the Subject that I am upon, doth not require any more, than that I ſhould ſpeak ſo far of the Wonders in it, as may ſerve to ſet out the excellency of this Freedom. And therfore, I do wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly omit the Wonders that may be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in the Incarnation, Conception, Birth, Life, Death, Reſurection, and Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſention of Chriſt; and ſhall only lay before you ſuch Wonders, as by which you may ſee, as I ſaid, that this is an excellent Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. I will mention ten of them.</p>
               <p n="1">1. What a <hi>Wonder</hi> is this, That <hi>the greateſt loſs ſhould be turned into the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt gain!</hi> 'tis ſo by this Freedom, it brings Saints the beſt eſtate that ever they were in, out of the worſt eſtate that ever they were in. 'Twas never ſo low with them, as it 'twas by the Fall of man; 'twas never ſo high with them, as it is by this Freedom by Chriſt, by which they are recovered from that. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith Phil. 3. 7. That <hi>the</hi>
                  <pb n="398" facs="tcp:64298:210"/> 
                  <hi>things that were gain to him, became loſs for Chriſt;</hi> and they who are the Children of God may alſo ſay, that <hi>the things that were loſs to them, are become gain by Chriſt.</hi> Oh how have they gained by the fall! And yet, beloved, we muſt not rejoyce in the fall, while we look barely upon that. No: 'tis matter of heart-breaking ſorrow, to think that ever <hi>Adam,</hi> and the World in him, ſinned away their innocency, as they did; and 'twill be matter of everlaſting mourning to many millions in Hell, that <hi>Adam</hi> did not abide in that honour which God gave him at the firſt; but we may, and we muſt rejoyce in Chriſt, who turns even this great evil to the great good of all that believe in him; to them it is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to <hi>Sampſons</hi> riddle, <hi>Out of the ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter came forth meat, and out of the ſtrong came forth ſweetneſs.</hi> If ever there were a bleſſed loſs, this was it, conſidering how God took occaſion from it to magnifie the riches of his Grace in his Son. This Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der you have ſet forth in <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 17, 18, 19. where he ſpeaks how we were ruin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> and raiſed in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That <hi>every ſin that a man hath commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, ſhould be damnable, and yet that all the</hi>
                  <pb n="399" facs="tcp:64298:210"/> 
                  <hi>ſins that he hath committed, ſhall not damn him.</hi> Certainly, there muſt be ſome won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful way found out to bring this to paſs; why, now this Freedom by Chriſt doth it. 'Tis the nature of every ſin, to deſerve Hell, not only the evils and miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of this preſent life, but alſo everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wrath in the World to come; and who ever is not made free by Chriſt, ſhall find that every ſin is a deadly ſin, and that 'tis not a <hi>Purgatory</hi> ſhall ſerve their turn, to cleanſe them from the leaſt tranſgreſſion. Oh, what a curſed practiſe is this of the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> to harden ſinners hearts thus, as if ſome ſins were of ſuch a ſmall guilt, and of ſuch a <hi>venial</hi> nature, as if Hell were a place of too great torment for them; but we ſay as <hi>Paul</hi> in another caſe, <hi>Nay, O man, who art thou that replieſt againſt God?</hi> Doth not this word ſay, that <hi>death is the wages of ſin,</hi> Rom. 6. ult. of ſin, as 'tis ſin, and by <hi>death</hi> there is meant, that which is in oppoſition to <hi>eternal life.</hi> But now, this Freedom makes innumerable damnable ſins not to damn; would you not count it a wonderful thing, if there ſhould be ſuch a thing as were able to quench un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quenchable fire? Why this Freedom does it, for thoſe that have it; it puts cut the
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:64298:211"/> Fire of Hell to them. Beloved, if you would imagine that one that hath this Freedom were to walk in the flames of Hell, they would not hurt him, they would all part, and give way, as who ſhould ſay, this is one that we muſt not faſten upon; as the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> paſt through the Red-Sea, that dreadful gulf; and all the waters fell back as if they were frighted at them; why, they were the people, who were under Gods redeeming love, therefore they were not drowned, no, not ſo much as wetted. So if thoſe who have obtained, through faith, a part in this Freedom, were to paſs to Heaven through Hell, it would be with them, as it were with the <hi>three Children,</hi> when they were caſt into the burning fiery furnance, <hi>Dan.</hi> 3. 28, 29.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That <hi>the higheſt mercy ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled to the ſtricteſt juſtice.</hi> It would have poſed any but a God to tell what to ſay to this, which way to ſhew the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ſeverity againſt ſin, and yet to ſhew the greateſt mercy to the ſinner; but by this Freedom this is done. Mercy doth not fall out with Juſtice for being ſo ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible; and Juſtice doth not fall out with Mercy for being ſo favourable; but both
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:64298:211"/> are well pleaſed in what is done, and ſo well pleaſed with one another, that as <hi>Davids</hi> expreſſion is, they can <hi>kiſs each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> as moſt intimate loving Friends. Gods Attributes, as I may ſpeak with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence, did never ſeem to be ſo near a fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling out, as when the Covenant of Works was broken by our firſt Parents. Mercy lookt as if it would fain have pittied us; but Juſtice looked as if it would by no means let it; theſe two, they were (only by way of alluſion to it) like the Twins in <hi>Rebekahs</hi> Womb, that ſtrugled toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>Gen.</hi> 25. 22. And one did not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail over the other, like two Armies when they fight, and one puts the other to the worſt, and ſo gets the Victory; but a ſweet peace and harmony was kept be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them, by the intended Freedom that ſhould be by Chriſt. Take notice by the way, what a dreadful breach ſin made in our firſt Apoſtacy, in that it did not only make us to fall out with God, but alſo as much as lay in us, to give an occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion (if it had been poſſible) for God to fall out with himſelf, to ſet Attribute a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Attribute, Mercy againſt Juſtice, and Juſtice againſt Mercy; but now by this Freedom all is quiet and well enough on
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:64298:212"/> both ſides, as the Apoſtle ſaith, when he is ſpeaking of it, in Gal. 3. 21. <hi>Is the law then againſt the promiſe? God forbid.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. That <hi>one that hath but a little grace, ſhould be looked upon as one that hath no ſin.</hi> What a Wonder is this! you have not one Child of God, but is very ready to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs that he hath but a <hi>little grace;</hi> yea, you'l ſay that's their holy modeſty and humilty; it may be 'tis not ſo indeed. I grant it is ſo in ſome, that they have much more of God and Chriſt in them, then they deſire to ſpeak of; and the more grace any one hath, the more apt, I think, they are to bewail their own vileneſs; and in this caſe we muſt not take every Child of God juſt at their word; but we may tell ſome of them, Come, bleſſed be God, you are better than you will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg. But really beloved, there be ſome in Chriſt that have but a very little Grace; ſome I know they have, and they muſt have. It is inconſiſtent with being truly in Chriſt, to have no grace at all; but there are ſome of them that are but new-born Babes; their Grace is but like the <hi>bruiſed reed,</hi> and the <hi>ſmoaking flax;</hi> they be for their Souls as <hi>Zacheus</hi> was for his Body, of whom 'tis ſaid, that he was
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:64298:212"/> 
                  <hi>little of ſtature, Luk.</hi> 19. 3. Now you may think, that certainly they who have ſo little Grace, muſt needs be counted by God to be perſons that have a great deal of ſin; but in reſpect of their juſtification by Chriſt, who hath made them free, it is not ſo. Obſerve 2 Cor. 7. 1. <hi>Let us cleanſe our ſelves from all filthineſs of the fleſh and ſpirit, perfecting holineſs in the fear of God.</hi> As if he ſhould ſay, Oh, Friends, you have a deal of filthineſs yet to be got out of you, both as to your outward converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and as to your inward frame; and you are very imperfect and ſhort in point of holineſs and grace; and yet he had told them before, <hi>cap.</hi> 5. 21. that being in Chriſt, they were made, or reckoned and counted ſuch as had no leſs a righteouſneſs than the righteouſneſs of God.</p>
               <p n="5">5. That <hi>the eyes of one ſhould be opened, that was born blind:</hi> this is ſuch a Wonder that you read in <hi>Joh.</hi> 9. 32. that <hi>ſince the World began, 'twas not heard that ever any man did it;</hi> but this is done in this Freedom; they who have it, were <hi>born blind,</hi> as blind as Moles, and ſo continued in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of ſpiritual ſight, till Chriſt had made them free; and then, as it is ſaid of <hi>Saul, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately</hi> there fell from their eyes, as it had
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:64298:213"/> been ſcales, and they received ſight <hi>forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with.</hi> This ſame Freedom by Chriſt, is that <hi>eye ſalve,</hi> which you read of <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 18. If any hath but the eyes of his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding anointed with it, it will make him ſee that he never ſaw, 'twill make him <hi>behold wondrous things out of Gods law;</hi> things that he paſt by, and took no more notice of, than a blind man doth of the beautifulleſt ſight that ever was ſeen.</p>
               <p n="6">6. That <hi>a man that is poſſeſſed by the Devil, ſhould have the Devil caſt out of him.</hi> Would you not count it a wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful thing to ſee <hi>a man that had been poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed with the Devil, and he his now caſt out?</hi> If any ſhould tell you, when you are in the ſtreets, There goes a man that a little while ago the Devil ſpoke in him, and dwelt in him as a man doth in his own houſe, where he counts himſelf at home; how would you look upon, and marvel to ſee ſuch a man! Well, this Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom is ſuch a thing that it <hi>caſts out Devils: Mary Magdalen</hi> that was brought into it, had <hi>ſeven Devils caſt out of her:</hi> what is the heart of men by nature, but an habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Devils? 'tis not an expreſſion that at all deſerves to be thought much on, to
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:64298:213"/> ſay, concerning wicked men, That <hi>the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil is in them,</hi> the Scripture it ſelf ſaies ſo, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 2. and the Devil was in <hi>Judas,</hi> Satan entred into him; and where the Devil is, there he will be, he will keep his hold till this Freedom comes, and then let him look to himſelf; he ſhall be caſt out, tho he hath legions with him. 'Tis obſervable there in <hi>Luk.</hi> 10. how the <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty</hi> Diſciples whom Chriſt had ſent out to Preach this Freedom, <hi>returned with joy</hi> to ſee what work the Goſpel made with the powers of darkneſs; <hi>Lord,</hi> ſay they, <hi>even the Devils are ſubject to us through thy name,</hi> verſ. 17. And mark what Chriſt ſaies again, verſ. 18. <hi>I beheld Satan as lightning fall from Heaven.</hi> As if he ſhould ſay, I foreſaw this, when I ſent you out, that it would be ſo; I knew that he would come down as ſwift as the lightning<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved, this Freedom makes ſinners <hi>vomit up Devils</hi> where it comes; what a wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful thing is this!</p>
               <p n="7">7. That <hi>the dead ſhould be raiſed;</hi> would you not Wonder to ſee a man raiſed from the dead? If ſo be that any of you ſhould ſtand in a Church-yard, and while you are looking upon a grave, and think of the perſon that lies dead and buried there,
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:64298:214"/> and how many years ago it is ſince he died, and that now he were rotten and conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med; to ſee him come forth, and ſtand up, and live? Why now, ſuch a marvellous work is done by this Freedom, it hath ſpiritually opened the graves of many thouſand Souls, and bleſſed be God we are not without ſome ſuch that live and walk amongſt us at this day, and that are with us in this Congregation. Beloved, do but turn your eyes now, and look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſuch a man, and ſuch a woman that fears God, and you have this wonderful ſight before you; concerning whom it may be ſaid, as in <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 1. <hi>And you hath he quickned, who were dead in treſpaſſes and ſins.</hi> By this Freedom God ſhews Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders to the dead, the dead ariſe and praiſe him. Pſal. 88. 10, 11, 12. <hi>Wilt thou ſhew wonders to the dead? ſhall the dead ariſe and praiſe thee? Selah. Shall thy loving-kindneſs be declared in the grave? or thy faithfulneſs in deſtruction? Shall thy won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders be known in the dark? and thy righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs in the land of forgetfulneſs?</hi> Why yes; God doth ſo in this caſe that I am upon. And therefore, if you that have any Relations, any Children, any Friends, that are for the condition of their Souls,
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:64298:214"/> ſtark dead, you cannot perceive the leaſt motion or breathing in them towards God, or any thing that is good: Why 'tis true, indeed, if you be ſpiritually alive your ſelves, you can't but do that which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons uſe to do for their Friends that are dead; you cannot but mourn for them, and in this ſenſe you may, and you muſt do that which would be a great ſin in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſenſe, you may pray for the dead, and you may be ſtirred up to it, by the conſideration of the wonderful nature of this Freedom, that it is a thing that will put <hi>life</hi> into the <hi>dead.</hi> You may look upon a wicked Child or Relation, it may be ſo far gone in ſin, that they are even paſt hope, as we uſe to do upon people when they are dead; oh, as long as they were alive, tho very ſick, yet while there's life there is hope, as we uſe to ſay; but when we ſee they are <hi>dead,</hi> then hope is gone. Yea, but as to this I am ſpeaking of, how know you but Chriſt may come to the grave of that dead Soul, and raiſe it, as he did to <hi>Laza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus?</hi> So beloved, we that are Miniſters of Chriſt, we preach of this Freedom to you, and as to divers of you we are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid we preach to the <hi>dead:</hi> and one would think, Why then, what hope is
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:64298:215"/> there? were it not as good to give over? Oh no! Preach we muſt, for all this, in hope that you may live; we are ſure that if God pleaſe to give you this Freedom, tho you have it not yet, when it comes, it ſhall do <hi>Wonders</hi> in you, 'twill fetch you out of your graves. Our Preaching to ſinners, 'tis like <hi>Ezekiels</hi> prophecying to the dry bones, <hi>cap.</hi> 37. God brought him and ſet him down in the midſt of a Valley full of them, <hi>verſ.</hi> 1, 2. and when he had been viewing them well, and ſeen what a ſad Spectacle there was; now, <hi>Son of man, can theſe bones live,</hi> ſaith he? doſt think 'tis poſſible that ever they ſhould live? And he anſwered, <hi>O Lord God thou know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt.</hi> As if he ſhould ſay, O Lord, that's with thee; who can reſolve that, but thy ſelf? <hi>verſe.</hi> 3. Well, in <hi>verſ.</hi> 4. Come, do thou prophecy upon them, ſaith God, and keep on prophecying, and ſee what I will do by it. Now, <hi>verſ.</hi> 7. the Prophet <hi>propheſied as he was commanded.</hi> As if he ſhould ſay, That I did, and that was all that I could do; but mark what wonderful ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs here was, ſee <hi>verſ.</hi> 7, 8, 9, 10. and you read in <hi>verſ.</hi> 10. that <hi>they lived,</hi> &amp;c. The Lord bleſs our preaching, as he bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed <hi>Ezekiels</hi> prophecying here.</p>
               <p n="8">
                  <pb n="409" facs="tcp:64298:215"/> 8. That <hi>Death it ſelf ſhould be killed.</hi> Is not this a ſtrange thing? You know what a killing thing Death is; you have heard of many, and ſeen many that have been ſlain by it, it is a killing all over the World: Whether you conſider Death naturally or ſpiritually, what a great deſtroyer 'tis! But now, that there ſhould be ſomething that ſhould cauſe Death it ſelf to dye; would not this be a wonder? why this Freedom doth it, it kills the bodily death by the Reſurrection of the body; it kills the ſpiritual Death, by their being riſen with Chriſt; it kills the eternal Death, by giving them eternal Life. You have two Verſes in Joh. 11. 25, 26. that ſpeak to this, ſays our Saviour there, <hi>I am the reſurrection and the life: he that believeth in me, tho he were dead, yet ſhall he live; And whoſoever liveth, and belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth in me, ſhall never dye.</hi> See alſo 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 54, 55, 56, 57. <hi>So when this corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſhall have put on incorruption, and this mortal ſhall have put on immortality, then ſhall be brought to paſs the ſaying that is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, Death is ſwallowed up in victory. O death, where is thy ſting? O grave, where is thy victory? The ſting of death is ſin, and the ſtrength of ſin is the law. But thanks be to God, which giveth us the victory, through our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>

                  <pb n="410" facs="tcp:64298:216"/> 9. That <hi>a man ſhould be made able to do all things.</hi> Would you not Wonder to ſee a man that is ſo able? It may be you will not believe that there is any ſuch man in the World: Nay, that if he could do all things, he would not be a man; and 'tis true, if you take <hi>[all things</hi>] in the largeſt ſenſe; he cannot do all things that God can do; but he can do all things through God, that <hi>he</hi> hath to do, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4. 11. A true Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an is in ſome ſenſe <hi>weak,</hi> and yet <hi>ſtrong,</hi> as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>When I am weak, then am I ſtrong,</hi> 2 Cor. 12. 10. And ſays our Saviour to the man that brought to him his Son poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed with a Devil, beſeeching him to help him, <hi>Mark</hi> 9. 23 <hi>If thou canſt believe, all things are poſſible to him that believeth.</hi> As if he ſhould ſay, Art thou got into Freedom? if ſo, there's nothing that thou haſt to do, but thou maiſt go through with it by faith in me. A man that hath this Freedom, and improves it as he ſhould do, he can be poor, he can be rich, he can do, and he can ſuffer, he can live, and he can dye, he can love his Enemies, he can gain by loſſes, he can prevail with God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="10">10. That <hi>a poor creature ſhould come to know what thoughts God had of him before</hi>
                  <pb n="411" facs="tcp:64298:216"/> 
                  <hi>the World began, and what he intends to do with him to all eternity.</hi> Why many will be ready to ſay, how is it ever poſſible that ſuch a thing ſhould be? Why, now 'tis one of the Wonders of this Freedom, that by the having of it a man may come to know this; if you look backward <hi>from</hi> all eternity, he may be ſure that God hath choſen him; if you look forward <hi>to</hi> all eternity, he may be ſure that God will receive him into Glory. See how <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks about this, 1 Theſ. 5. 9. <hi>For God hath not appointed us to wrath, but to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſalvation by our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Many there be, who are in this Freedom, that are aſſured of this, and ſuch as are in it, tho they be not ſure as yet of it, yet they are in the way to it.</p>
               <p>You ſee ſomething of the Wonders of this Freedom; and now is it not an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Freedom alſo upon this account? I will only add this, That the Scripture holds forth to us, that Gods wonderful works muſt have five Duties performed about them, and ſo muſt this wonderful Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. (1.) They muſt be talked of, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 105. 2. So now, oh ſpeak of this <hi>wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Freedom</hi> one to another, as you ſit in the houſe, and as you walk by the way;
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:64298:217"/> declare what God hath done for his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple by Jeſus Chriſt. (2.) They muſt be <hi>conſidered,</hi> pondered upon, <hi>Joh.</hi> 37. 13. So this wonderful Freedom you muſt <hi>ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve</hi> the Wonders in it, have deep and ſerious thoughts of it: Search into it by Meditation; Myſteries cannot be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood by a ſuperficial looking upon them, but<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they muſt be dived into. (3.) They muſt be <hi>remembred, Pſal.</hi> 105. 4, 6. So take heed of forgetting this wonderful Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; 'tis a mercy never to be forgotten. (4.) God muſt be <hi>praiſed</hi> for them; yea, praiſed and praiſed again, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 136. 1, 2, 3, 4. So highly bleſs God for this won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful Freedom; ſee in two <hi>Pſalms</hi> which are made about it, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 72. and he cloſes up all with this; <hi>verſ.</hi> 18. 19. <hi>Bleſſed be the Lord God, the God of Iſrael, who only doth wondrous things.

<pb n="413" facs="tcp:64298:217"/> by Chriſt. I will end this Seventh thing of the Wonders of this Freedom, with that Scripture, Acts 13. 38, to 42. <hi>Be it known unto you therefore, men and brethren, that through this man is preached unto you the forgivneſs of ſins. And by him all that believe are juſtified from all things, from which ye could not be juſtified by the Law of Moſes. Beware therefore, leſt that come upon you which is ſpoken of in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets; Behold, ye deſpiſers, and wonder, and periſh: for I work a work in your days, a work which you ſhall in no wiſe believe, tho a man declare it unto you.</hi> Do you <hi>Wonder</hi> at the things you have heard? Oh! take heed that you don't <hi>Wonder and periſh</hi> for want of believing of them.</p>

               </head>
               <p>AND now, is this <hi>Freedom of Chriſt ſuch an excellent Freedom,</hi> as you have heard it is? Then I ſhall finiſh this fifth Branch, and ſo this whole Text with ſeven Uſes.</p>
               <p>1. <hi>Of Information.</hi> 2. <hi>of Admiration.</hi> 3. <hi>of Lamentation.</hi> 4. <hi>of Examination.</hi> 5. <hi>of Expoſtulation.</hi> 6. <hi>of Exhortation.</hi> 7. <hi>of Conſolation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Uſe I. Of <hi>Information.</hi> It informs of four things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>That the remedy that is prepared for ſinners miſery, is beyond all exception;</hi> their miſery is their Bondage by ſin, their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy is Freedom by Chriſt, and 'tis be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all exception, for 'tis <hi>excellent Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</hi> The Lord Jeſus cares not who looks upon his redeeming-work, 'tis done ſo
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:64298:218"/> well, it wants nothing to make it ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent and all-ſufficient for the ends and purpoſes to which it was intended: we are ſure therefore, that if we can but uſe this ſoveraign Plaiſter as we ought, it will without queſtion heal our wound. There is that in Chriſt, that will do our work; do but make trial, and you'l find 'tis true; for in this caſe trial is all in all. Chriſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires to be put to the proof, whether he cannot do all things for a poor Soul that it hath need ſhould be done for it. If you'l but venture your Souls, he will ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture his Salvation; what would you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire more to manifeſt that a receit for a diſeaſe is the beſt that can be got, than that every one that hath made uſe of it, ſhould give their approving-teſtimony, that they have been cured by it: Now this is the witneſs, that all believers will give of Chriſt. If you ſhould go up and down for their hands, they will be all ready to ſign and ſeal to the great cures that they have by him, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53. 5. 'tis as it were the general voice of all that have made uſe of Chriſt; <hi>We are healed.</hi> Again, it informs us,</p>
               <pb n="416" facs="tcp:64298:219"/>
               <p n="2">2. That <hi>there is ſomething that is much better than that which the men of the World do ſpend their time and thoughts about.</hi> The truth is, they follow this World, as if it were the beſt thing that ever was, or e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſhall be. But, ah Sirs, you (whoſe life and labour is thus laid out) are miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken. There is an excellent Freedom by Chriſt, that is better than all that you cark and care, and rap and rend for. Would I could but tell what to ſay to you, to bring you out of love with this World: you that are ſo much in love with it, What do you ſee or find in it, that you ſhould ſet your hearts upon it? you run <hi>after</hi> that, and that runs <hi>from</hi> you, and that ſo faſt, that ſome of you cannot overtake it for your lives. I may ſay, that the World looks upon ſome perſons, as if it were <hi>afraid to come</hi> near them; they would fain lay hands upon it, and God wont let them; he bids the things of this World run away from them, and this ſurely is in much mercy to ſome, for God ſees that if they ſhould gain the World, they would loſe their Souls; and if he bears a love to them, he had rather they ſhould miſs of Earth than Heaven. Well, but it may be God ſuffers ſome of you to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertake
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:64298:219"/> this World, you make ſuch haſte after it, and when you have got it, what have you got? I don't ſpeak to leſſen thankfulneſs for any of theſe outward mercies; but my drift is to ſet the World in its place, and this Freedom in its place; but what have you gotten? Why, I will caſt it up for you, and the whole ſum a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounts to this, You have got that, that you muſt loſe, all this getting 'tis in order to loſing; you have it, but you cannot hold it; when you have got the World, you have got Vanity, you have got vexation of ſpirit, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 1. 2. and will you ſpend your whole time and thoughts for this? I will throw ſome Scripture-Water upon the Fire of this Love to the World, to ſee if it will put it out. Conſider ſeriouſly theſe three Text, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2. 15. <hi>Jam.</hi> 4. 4. <hi>Luk.</hi> 12. 20, 21. Again, this imforms us,</p>
               <p n="3">3. That <hi>this Freedom by Chriſt is high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly worth the pains that any Soul which hath it, hath taken to obtain it, or that any Soul is now taking to get it;</hi> oh, it will quit the coſt, and bear the charges, for 'tis excellent Freedom. It is a great encouragement to a man to lay out his labour upon a thing,
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:64298:220"/> when he is ſure he ſhall not loſe his labour; convince him that he ſhall be a gainer, and a great gainer, and you have done e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to ſet him a work. If you had but told him of a probability, and a hope of advantage, you ſhould have ſeen him ſtir; but if he can be ſure that it will be a profitable buſineſs, he thinks long ere he is at it. Now I aſſure you, from the ſure word of God, That take what pains you will to get this Freedom, it ſhall be like that ſeed, that was ſown in the ground, it will be encreaſed thirty, ſixty, yea an hundredfold; you'l find it the beſt em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment that ever you were about; there never was any Child of God that wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, Would I had not medled with this Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom by Chriſt, nor ever will; Chriſt ſcorns that any that trade with him, ſhould be loſers. As they ſhall not want for work, ſo they ſhall not want for wages. 'Tis true, he doth expect that they who will have his Freedom, ſhould take great pains for it, but he will graciouſly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward their great pains with great gains. If they will fell all that they have, to get the Pearl, they ſhall find that the Pearl, when they have it, is a <hi>Pearl of great</hi>
                  <pb n="419" facs="tcp:64298:220"/> 
                  <hi>price.</hi> I would put you in mind here of ſome Verſes in the 2. and 3. chapters of <hi>Rev.</hi> which I would allude to; read <hi>cap.</hi> 2. 7. <hi>To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the midſt of the paradice of God.</hi> Verſ. 11. <hi>He that over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh, ſhall not be hurt of the ſecond death.</hi> Verſ. 17. <hi>To him that overcometh, will I give to eat of the hiden manna, and will give him a white-ſtone, and in the ſtone a new name written, which no man knoweth ſaving be that receiveth it.</hi> And chap. 3. v. 5. <hi>He that overcometh, the ſame ſhall be cloathed in white raiment, and I will not blot out his name out of the book of life, but I will confeſs his name before my Father, and before his angels.</hi> Verſ. 12. <hi>Him that overcometh, will I make a pillar in the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of my God, and he ſhall go no more out: and I will write upon him the name of God, and the name of the city of my God, which is new Jeruſalem, which cometh down out of heaven from my God: and I will write upon him my new name.</hi> Verſ. 21. <hi>To him that overcometh, will I grant to ſit with me in my throne, even as I alſo overcame, and am ſet down with my Father in his throne.</hi> That which I ſay to you from hence, is this:
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:64298:221"/> There are difficulties, and great difficulties, in the way of obtaining this Freedom, but will you not be daunted at them? but labour ſo as to overcome? will you reſolve through the help of God, let there be what pain there will, I'll overcome them? Why then, you ſee how every verſe that I have read to you, carries its gains with it. Again, this informs us,</p>
               <p n="4">4. That <hi>the people of God are an excellent people;</hi> they muſt needs be ſo, for they are gotten into this excellent Freedom. This is the company, that no company in the World can compare with. I know that the people of God don't deſire to commend or ſpeak honourably of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. But beloved, I have here a very fair occaſion to commend them to you; very like ſome of you, may have low and mean thoughts of them, and the rather, becauſe you ſee them ſo contemptible in their outward appearance; it may be ſome of your cloathes are better than theirs, and ſome of your eſtates are greater than theirs, and ſome of your food is finer than theirs, and ſome of your kindred may be richer than theirs: Well, I grant this may be true one way; but I am ſure if you be
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:64298:221"/> out of Chriſt, 'tis falſe another way. Be you what you will in wordly reſpects, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the account of the condition that this excellent Freedom hath brought them into, you that are out of Chriſt, never wore ſuch <hi>cloathes</hi> as they do, for they have put on the new man, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and they go every day of the week in robes, ſee <hi>Rev.</hi> 7. 9, 13, 14, 15. And for <hi>Eſtate,</hi> that which you have in the World, is nothing to what they have in Chriſt, for they are <hi>heirs of God, and joint heirs with Chriſt,</hi> Rom. 8. 17. and the <hi>Promiſes</hi> are theirs, and the <hi>Kingdom of Heaven</hi> is theirs, and <hi>all things</hi> are theirs; and for <hi>food,</hi> you never in all your lives taſted any thing ſo ſweet, as that which they feed upon; they eat of the <hi>bread which came down from God,</hi> they <hi>eat the fleſh, and drink the blood of the Son of man;</hi> whoſe <hi>fleſh is meat in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, and whoſe blood is drink indeed:</hi> and for <hi>hindred,</hi> why all your carnal Relations are no better than beggars in compariſon of them, that they are a kin to; <hi>Chriſt is not aſhamed to call them brethren,</hi> Heb. 2. 11. And <hi>God is not aſhamed to be called their God,</hi> cap. 11. 16. Obj. <hi>Why, then ſure if they have all this excellency by their Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:64298:222"/> their Freedom will make them proud. Anſ.</hi> No beloved, for all this, they were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo humble, and never had ſuch mean thoughts of themſelves, as <hi>ſince</hi> they got in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this Freedom; they never loathed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves till now; they were more lifted up in their miſery, than now they are in their excellency. Now they deſire to give God all the Glory, and to take nothing to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves but ſhame; tho God hath made them <hi>great,</hi> yet they do not count themſelves <hi>good, Rom.</hi> 7. 18.</p>

                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 2. Of <hi>Admiration.</hi> That ever ſuch an excellent Freedom ſhould be beſtowed upon the Sons of men. There are two things in this that may raiſe our Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That ever it ſhould be given to <hi>men;</hi> that the Lord ſhould paſs by Angels with a purpoſe never to recover them when they were fallen, and that we ſhould be thoſe to whom he would ſend redemption. He might have let us all alone: Angels to periſh, and mankind to periſh; and if he would have ſaved any, he might have bid his Son go take the nature of Angels, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:64298:222"/> the Devils, (but that it would not conſiſt with his everlaſting purpoſe) and have left <hi>Adam</hi> and all his poſterity under the curſe; but that he ſhould pitch upon us, to be the ſubjects that ſhould be capable of this Freedom, how is free Grace to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired! that God ſhould overlook thoſe that ſtood nearer to him by their creation, then we did, to look upon <hi>us!</hi> The ſpirits of darkneſs are left in diſpair, while we are under hope; they and we were all miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble creatures by the fall, firſt of one, and then of the other; but their miſery was irrecoverable, ours is a recoverable miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 26. God hath an Election amongſt us, but he hath none among the Devils; and therefore, the door of mercy is ſhut againſt them, never to be opened, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 4. <hi>Jude verſ.</hi> 6. Oh, how are we beholding to God, that he would reſerve Mercy for us, when he reſerves Wrath for the fallen Angels! there he made quick work; they fell into Condemnation, and God <hi>ſealed</hi> up their Condemnation; there is not ſo much as a poſſibility that God will ever be reconciled to them; but with us he was willing to renew a better Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant than that was which we brake; there
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:64298:223"/> is pity, and pardon, and peace for <hi>us</hi> in Chriſt. Now have not we cauſe to admire this, and to ſay, as Heb. 2. 6. <hi>What is man, that thou art mindful of him, and the ſon of man that thou viſiteſt him?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. That not only men, but ſome of the <hi>worſt of men,</hi> ſhould have the benefit of this Freedom. I mean, not only a tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral benefit, for ſo all have; but the ſaving everlaſting benefit of it. You read in the Scripture, of ſome of the very worſt of men, that have been made free by Chriſt. When this Freedom came to them at firſt, it found ſome of them amongſt the <hi>Thieves,</hi> and others amongſt the <hi>Drunkards,</hi> and others amongſt the <hi>Whoremongers,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers amongſt the <hi>Idolaters,</hi> as it did the <hi>Corinthians;</hi> and others amongſt the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutors,</hi> and the <hi>Blaſphemers,</hi> as it did <hi>Paul;</hi> and others amongſt the <hi>Crucifiers</hi> of Chriſt, as it did the <hi>Jews;</hi> and have you not heard ſometimes of ſome notorious ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner or other that became a new man, and through grace was afterwards as much for God, as before he was the for Devil? that to ones thinking was come even to the height of wickedneſs, and yet brought home? Beloved, God will have this Freedom by
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:64298:223"/> Chriſt, and the exceeding riches of it, glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified even in this World; and therefore he gives it ſometimes to the very dregs of ſinners. And who indeed is there of thoſe, that have obtained a fellowſhip in this great Salvation, but hath cauſe to admire that ever it ſhould be given to him? And to ſay, Oh! God had mercy upon a grievous ſinner, when he had mercy upon <hi>me.</hi> It is certain that the loving-kindneſs of God in Jeſus Chriſt, will be admired by every Soul, upon whom it lights; and ſuch a one is ready to think, That never was there any ſinner that did more need mercy, or leſs deſerve it: and the Reaſon of this is, becauſe where this Freedom comes, it works ſuch a ſenſe of ones vileneſs upon the heart, that tho indeed there may in ſome reſpects be greater ſinners than ones ſelf; yet one cannot but look upon ones ſelf as one of the greateſt Wonders of Mercy that ever was, as <hi>Paul</hi> did, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 15, 16. And when God ſhall have gathered all his Children to glory: Oh beloved, what a wonderful company there will be; I don't mean ſo much for multitude, tho that will be innumerable, as to think what ſinners theſe were, and eſpecially, ſome of
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:64298:224"/> them. Oh! the ſtories that might be told of them in Heaven, to raiſe matter of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting Admiration, that one who had been formerly ſuch a grievous ſinner on Earth, ſhould prove notwithſtanding a glorious Saint in Heaven. Oh wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful!</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 3. Is this Freedom by Chriſt ſuch an excellent Freedom? then here is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing for. <hi>Lamentation</hi> and Mourning: Beloved, we have often through Gods Mercy met together: Oh! that we could now mourn together. And you that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not weep with your eyes, oh, that you would mourn in your hearts. Why, but you may ſay, What is there here to mouth for? This excellent Freedom is cauſe of rejoycing? Yea indeed, ſo 'tis, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>is glad tidings of great joy, if all things about it were well with us; but alas, the Lord knows they are not. I pray therefore, conſider four things, for the piercing of your hearts in this Uſe of <hi>Lamentation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>That ever we ſhould be the cauſe of putting<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> who pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:64298:224"/> this Freedom for us, <hi>to ſo much pain and grief,</hi> as he underwent in the doing of it. Oh! what bitter mourning ſhould we make for our ſins, that laid ſuch a load upon Chriſt; that we could never have had this excellent Freedom, if he had not ſuffered beyond expreſſion. We may ſay, thoſe of us that are made free by Chriſt, he hath put us into a good condition; but oh, into what a bad condition did our ſins put him! he hath brought us joy, but we brought him ſorrow; he hath brought us reſt, but we brought him travel of Soul; he hath brought us life, but we brought him death; he hath brought us bleſſing, but we brought him a curſe; he helped us to a great deal of Mercy, but we helped him to a great deal of miſery: in reſpect of his ſufferings he was the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerableſt man that ever lived. Now friends, this was your ſins, and my ſins, that brought him to this, that made Jeſus Chriſt to have a very Hell upon Earth; and ſhall we not mourn for this? Oh! that the Lord would perform that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to us this day, <hi>Zech.</hi> 12. 10. <hi>And I will pour upon the houſe of David,</hi>
                  <pb n="428" facs="tcp:64298:225"/> 
                  <hi>and upon the inhabitants of Jeruſalem, a ſpirit of grace and of ſupplications, and they ſhall look upon him whom they have pierced, and they ſhall mourn for him, as one mourneth for his only ſon, and ſhall be in bitterneſs for him as one that is in bitterneſs for his firſt born.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>That God hath no more Glory from us, for all this grace that he hath beſtowed upon us.</hi> This Freedom is actually given to ſome of us; and thoſe Scriptures through the tender Mercy of God may be applied, I doubt not, to ſome of you, <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 21. <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 13. <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 13, 19. But will you not ſay your ſelves, (I know you will) that you do fall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding ſhort of ſuch a walking, as this excellent Freedom engages you to? Beloved, I am glad to ſee any of you that are in Chriſt, ſo good; but truly, the beſt of us have cauſe to mourn that we are no better. Oh, what a people ſhould we be, for whom the Lord Jeſus Chriſt laid down his precious Life, and ſhed his precious Blood! You do God ſome Service, bleſſed be his Name; but ſhould you not do him more? You bring forth ſome fruit, but ſhould you
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:64298:225"/> not bring forth more? 'Tis not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough for you to be gracious, but you ſhould be zealous. Chriſt, as I may ſo ſpeak, hoped you would, when he gave you this Freedom, ſee Tit. 2. 14. <hi>Who gave himſelf for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purifie unto himſelf a peculiar people, zealous of good works.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. That <hi>ſo many are gone to Hell for refuſing this excellent Freedom.</hi> Oh, what a ſad thing 'tis to think how many Souls have periſhed for want of clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing with Chriſt! 'Tis true, they had other ſins, but whatever other ſins they had, they would have been forgiven, if they had not neglected this great Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; that made them that they could not eſcape. As the receiving of this Freedom by Faith, hath been the Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of <hi>many;</hi> ſo the refuſing of it by unbelief, hath been the Damnation of more; tho poor wretches, they are not here to be told of it, becauſe they are now gone to their own place. Oh! the price that they had once in their hands, but now they have loſt it for ever, and it may be ſome of theſe might
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:64298:226"/> be your Friends and Relations, the Wives of your own boſoms, and the Children of your own bodies. Well, if they were, they are periſhed without hope, there's no fetching them back a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain: you may perhaps mourn to think what is become of them, but now they are paſt recovery; your prayers can do them no good, and your tears can do them no good, and now you muſt labour to reſt ſatisfied with this, that the Will of the Lord is done, and that he is glorified, tho it be in their eternal de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That <hi>ſo many ſinners, tho they are yet on Earth, will ſhortly be in Hell too, for the ſame ſin:</hi> For alas! how many be there of thoſe who are yet alive, that are making light of Chriſt, and of this excellent Freedom, and many of them will go on to do ſo, to their dying day, and ſo come to the ſame paſs to which the unrepenting ſinners before them have brought themſelves. The generations of Chriſt refuſers is not all gone; they that were in the ages that are paſt, are ſwept and ſnatch away; but there are others that ſtand
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:64298:226"/> up in their room; there's a ſucceſſion of theſe ungodly hard-hearted ſinners, that tho we offer Chriſt and Salvation to them, and beſeech them as for our lives to be reconciled to God, yet they go on, and 'tis to be feared will go on in the broad way that leadeth to Deſtruction. 'Twas a ſad word that Chriſt ſpake to them, in Joh. 5. 40. <hi>Ye will not come to me that ye might have life.</hi> Mark, he doth not ſay, <hi>you do not come;</hi> but he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livers it in a kind of hopeleſs expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>you will not come.</hi> As if he ſhould ſay, I ſee ſome of you are of that tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, that as you <hi>are,</hi> you <hi>will</hi> be; you <hi>are</hi> in your ſins, and you <hi>will</hi> be in your ſins: let them that hear me, mark it concerning you, if you do not <hi>dye out of me.</hi> I pray God it be not ſo with ſome of you that are here. Really Sirs, 'tis matter of mourning to ſee how ſome of you trifle in the things of your Souls; would it not grieve ones heart to think that ſome of you that have attended upon all this that hath been preached upon this Text, ſhould yet look after a Chriſt no more than you do? I am this day to finiſh this work,
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:64298:227"/> and I am afraid of divers of you, that this Text will leave you as dead as it found you. Well, the Lord be witneſs between you and me, whether I have not ſet Life and Death before you, and whether if you periſh, it be for want of being ſufficiently told of the miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of your Bondage of ſin, or of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of the Freedom by Chriſt. Beloved, 'twill be a ſad thing, when ſuch a Text as this is <hi>done,</hi> to leave any of you <hi>undone.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>

                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 4. Of <hi>Examination.</hi> You have heard much of this excellent Freedom: put this queſtion home to your ſelves, every one of you, <hi>Am I got out of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon yet?</hi> How ſhall I know that, you'l ſay? <hi>Anſ.</hi> Take it in three things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. If a man be got out of Priſon, he hath made his peace with thoſe that caſt him in; ſuppoſe it be for debt that one hath been laid up, and you ſee him afterwards out of priſon, and you ask him, why, you were a priſoner, how got you out? Why, ſaies he, I have compounded with my Creditors, I have
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:64298:227"/> made my peace, or I have got an able ſurety to be bound for me. So Sirs, have you made your peace with God, for your great debt of ſin? Have you got Jeſus Chriſt to ſtand bound for you? Why then, you are no longer Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners; but if you have not peace with God through Chriſt, you are in Priſon ſtill, for the condition of your Souls, ſee Zech. 9. 11. <hi>As for thee alſo, by the blood of thy covenant, I have ſet forth thy priſoners out of the pit, wherein is no water.</hi> God ſends forth none out of <hi>Priſon,</hi> but by the <hi>Blood</hi> of that <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi> which Chriſt hath made with God, on the behalf of the <hi>Priſoner</hi> that he will pay the debt for him.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Another ſign that a man is got out of Priſon, is, That he bears a great love to him that freed him: If one comes and ſees him lye there in a ſad condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and hath compaſſion upon him; Well, ſaith he, I'll procure your Freedom for you; I'll undertake it; he will have a great reſpect for that perſon, to be ſure, when he hath done it. Oh! ſaith he, if it had not been for this Friend, I
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:64298:228"/> had periſhed; I have reaſon to make much of him. Sirs, if you don't prize Chriſt, you are in Priſon ſtill; you have not <hi>his Freedom,</hi> if he hath not your <hi>beſt Love,</hi> Col. 1. 13. <hi>Who hath deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us from the power of darkneſs, and hath tranſlated us into the kingdom of his dear Son.</hi> Mark how thoſe words, his <hi>dear</hi> Son, are brought in with the men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this Freedom; and I look upon them as to be underſtood, not only in reference to his Father, but alſo thoſe who are freed by him; As if he ſhould ſay, Dear to his <hi>Father,</hi> and dear to <hi>us</hi> too.</p>
               <p n="3">3. If a man be got out of Priſon or Bondage, he is afraid<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to go thither again; he thinks what a ſad condition he had when he was there, and he deſires he may not come there again: ſo do you fear and watch, leſt any ſin bring you into Bondage again. Is there no luſt, that you would be any longer a ſervant to? Do you dread the thoughts of holding ſecret corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpodence with any falſe way? Why then you are made free. You may ſay,
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:64298:228"/> as 'tis in Pſal. 124. 7. <hi>Our ſoul is eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped as a bird out of the ſnare of the fowler; the ſnare is broken, and we are eſcaped.</hi> If you be not made free by Chriſt, you will have a darling ſin.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 5. Of <hi>Expoſtulation.</hi> And that with ſuch as are not made free by Chriſt: And here, tho I ſhall ſpeak but few words, yet I wiſh they may be pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing. What mean you, that you don't accept of Chriſts excellent Freedom? 'Tis to be had, and you want it, and you'l be eternally loſt without it, and yet you abide in your Bondage; the ſins you had, you have ſtill; the ſloth that was in you, is in you ſtill. I dont perceive ſome of you ſtir a jot to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the New-birth: I have been en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring upon this Text, to hale you to Chriſt, and yet you hang back. Why Sirs, for the Lords ſake, what do you mean? I thought that if any Scripture in the Bible would have won you, this and that which hath been ſaid upon it, would have done it. And now after I have delivered all this meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage from God to you; will you not
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:64298:229"/> here? I muſt needs here put you in mind of the Prophets words to <hi>David;</hi> what he ſaid to him, when he had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered Gods meſſage to him, that I ſay to you, 2 Sam. 24. 13. Now adviſe, <hi>and ſee what an anſwer I ſhall return to him that ſent me.</hi> You have heard what I have ſaid from Chriſt to you; now let me hear what I ſhall ſay from you to Chriſt; I muſt go back to him for a new meſſage (now I have done with this ſubject); But what, Sirs, ſhall I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer him, when he asks me what is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of the old; You preached a great while about Freedom that I had to give ſinners, how did it ſpeed with your hearers? I ſhould be glad with all my heart, that I might be able to ſay to Chriſt of this Text, as they did of the Talents, ſee <hi>Luk.</hi> 19. 15, 16, 18. Lord, thy pound hath gained ten pounds, ſaith one, five pounds, ſaith another. So that my Text that I have been a trading with for God amongſt you, had gained ten Souls, or five Souls, or one Soul, rather then nothing. Well, but what ſhall I ſay to him that ſent me? I muſt go to reckon with him for this Text, and as near as
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:64298:229"/> I can, I muſt give him a faithful account, and that is, that I don't hear of one that is converted by all theſe Sermons; not a Man or Woman of you that were out of Chriſt when I began them, have been with me, to bring me this joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful news, that this Text hath been the word of Life and Power to you. If any ſuch mercy hath been ſhewed to you, 'tis between God and your ſelves: but if it be ſo indeed, methinks you ſhould eaſily conclude, Certainly, Gods beginning to work upon me, under ſuch a mans Miniſtry, muſt needs be wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come newes to him: and therefore, I'll go to him, and tell him what God hath done for my Soul: And Friends, I long to ſee ſome of you to come to my houſe upon ſuch an errand. I know my la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour hath not been in vain, (in ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this Freedom) to them here, who are in Chriſt Jeſus; but God hath given them many a ſweet refreſhment in the hearing of it; and if there ſhould be none that are brought in, yet, bleſſed be God, that there are ſome that are built up. But oh Sirs, what will become of you, that have neither gotten, nor
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:64298:230"/> are getting this Freedom? Why don't you conſider before it be too late, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der what Offers of Grace you live; what heart-rending thoughts do you think you ſhall have a little while hence, when you ſhall look back upon the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities you have loſt, without hope of having any more? Will it not be an heavy charge againſt you, that you have deſpiſed a precious Chriſt, and loſt a precious Soul? If you believe that you are ſinners, what's the reaſon that you don't regard a Saviour? Is Chriſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding to you, to accept of his Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation? or are you beholding to him, that he is ſo willing you ſhould have it? If you could be contented to live in your ſins all your days, can you be contented to ſuffer for them to all eternity? I tell you, Hell is ready for you, if you will not repent and believe the Goſpel; and the more calls you have now, the more Torments you'l have there? Is it fit that ſuch ſinful Worms as you are, ſhould take upon you to tell Chriſt that you wont have him? And do you think that he doth not obſerve your unkindneſs, and
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:64298:230"/> frowardneſs to him, tho for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent he lets you alone? If you have no love for Chriſt, have you none for your ſelves? Will this World laſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways, that you provide no better for another? Do you think that Chriſt can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not tell what to do with his mercy, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he offers it to you? And now I have blown the Trumpet, and given you warning, becauſe I ſee the Sword is a coming, now read <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33. the nine firſt Verſes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> 6. Of <hi>Exhortation.</hi> Take it amongſt you in three things, briefly.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Bleſs the Lord, that you live under the Miniſtration of ſuch an excellent Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</hi> Oh Sirs, think what a mercy you have, and be thankful. How many be there that want what you enjoy! God hath made the way to Heaven plain before you: You may ſee by the light that ſhines amongſt you, how fain, he would have you ſaved. You may read thoſe words as your own Princiledge, Luke 1. 78, 79. <hi>Through the tender mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of God, the day-ſpring from on high</hi>
                  <pb n="440" facs="tcp:64298:231"/> 
                  <hi>hath viſited us; To give light to them that ſit in darkneſs, and in the ſhadow of death; to guide our feet into the way of peace.</hi> God might have left you, as he hath many, without the means of Grace; your feet might have ſtumbled upon the dark Mountains; you might have gone all your lives, and not have heard ſo much of Chriſt, as you have heard from this one Text. Oh! that now you could be praiſing God for his goodneſs to your Souls. I ſay no more to you but this, Unthankfulneſs for the Goſpel, endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers the Goſpel; they who don't look upon it, as a great mercy, are not like to have ſuch a mercy long.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If any of you be looking after Freedom for your Souls; or when e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it ſhall pleaſe God, that any of you ſhall, (which the Lord grant, may be quickly; for in this caſe delays are dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous); <hi>be ſure you look after Freedom in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed:</hi> take heed that you be not decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved with a Counterfeit, with the ſhew and ſhadow of this Freedom, but that it be that very Freedom which Chriſt gives to believers. An hypocrite he
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:64298:231"/> thinks he hath this Freedom, but he is in Bondage ſtill; you never have this true Freedom, till your hearts be right in the ſight of God; <hi>Acts</hi> 8. com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare <hi>verſ.</hi> 21, 23. together. There be two great fears concerning perſons that are out of Chriſt; the firſt, whether ever they will look after him <hi>at all,</hi> and then, if they do; whether it will be <hi>in Truth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Don't abuſe this excellent Freedom,</hi> you that have it. You uſe to ſay, 'tis pity that good things ſhould be abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. Now this Freedom by Chriſt, is not only a good thing, but an excellent thing; oh, don't abuſe it then, and if you would not do ſo, ever remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that Exhortation which <hi>Paul</hi> gave the <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi> which I alſo give to you, 1 Theſſ. 2. 12. <hi>That ye would walk worthily of God, who hath called you unto his kingdom and glory.</hi> I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you, don't deal <hi>unworthily</hi> with your Freedom, don't walk <hi>unbecom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly</hi> in it; <hi>adorn</hi> the Goſpel now, with a Converſation in Chriſt; 'tis not for you to ſin as others do; you muſt
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:64298:232"/> be holy; 'tis not for you to ſleep as others do, you muſt <hi>watch and be ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber;</hi> 'tis not for you to mind earthly things, and the fooliſh faſhions of this Generation; For <hi>Chriſt gave himſelf for you, that he might deliver you from this preſent evil World;</hi> 'tis not for you to be carried away with errors in your Judgment, for the <hi>truth hath made you free;</hi> 'tis not for you to enſlave your conſciences to the wills of men, 'tis againſt your Freedom, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 23. Thus in all things, 'tis your great du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty <hi>to ſtand-faſt in the liberty, wherewith Chriſt hath made you free, and not to be entangled again with the yoke of bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 7. Of <hi>Conſolation,</hi> to you, who are made free by Chriſt. I have but two things to ſay to you by way of <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>It is better with you now, than it is with any in the World beſides your ſelves.</hi> Is not that a comfort to you? I may ſay of you, in reſpect of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, as <hi>Solomon</hi> doth of the vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:64298:232"/> Woman, <hi>Thou excelleſt them all.</hi> I remember what <hi>Balaam</hi> ſaid, when he looked upon the Children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> whom God had redeemed, Numb. 23. 9, <hi>Lo, the people ſhall dwell alone, and ſhall not be reckoned among the nations,</hi> And then chap. 24. 5. <hi>How goodly are thy tents, O Jacob, and thy tabernacles. O Iſrael!</hi> As if he ſhould ſay, Oh! what a company here is, in compariſon of the reſt of the World! Beloved, by this excellent Freedom, Chriſt hath made you high above all the glory of the World. Whereas before you were but as common ſtones: by this Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom he hath turned you into <hi>Jewels,</hi> into a peculiar treaſure to God. How can you read that Scripture without rejoycing, 1 Pet. 2. 9. <hi>Ye are a choſen generation, a royal prieſthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people.</hi> Envy not the men of the World for their poor en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments; you are in a better condition then they are. God hath done more for the leaſt of you, than he hath done for the greateſt of them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As it is better with you now

Your Freedom will ere long bring you to another place; it will hand you into Heaven: you are not brought out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> to die in the Wilderneſs (as thoſe did, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved not); but to enter into the reſt that remaineth for the people of God; and whatever is here wanting to make you fully happy, ſhall there be recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and enjoyed for ever; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the faith of this go on to wait (yet a little longer) for the Son of God from Heaven, whom he raiſed
